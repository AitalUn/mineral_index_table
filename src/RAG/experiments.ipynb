Introduction\\n\\nRemote sensing broadly refers to the indirect measurement of emitted electromagnetic energy using a camera or sensor. Application of this technology to agriculture makes use of a wide range of instruments, from airborne cameras to sensors mounted on orbiting satellites. The approach provides valuable insight into agronomic management, salinity and nutrient status.

Remote sensing represents a potential method to monitor and estimate biomass so as to increase biomass feedstock production from energy crops. This paper reviews the biophysical properties of biomass and remote sensing methods for monitoring energy crops for site-specific management. While several research studies have addressed the agronomic dimensions of this approach, more research is required on perennial energy crops in order to maximize the yield of biomass feedstock. Assessment of established methods could lead to a new strategy to monitor energy crops for the adoption of site-specific management in biomass feedstock production. In this article, satellite, aerial and ground-based remote sensing's were reviewed and focused on the spatial and temporal resolutions of imagery to adopt for site-specific management. We have concluded that the biomass yield prediction, the ground-based sensing is the most suitable to establish the calibration model and reference for aerial and satellite remote sensing. The aerial and satellite remote sensing are required for wide converge of planning and policy implementations of biomass feedstock production systems.\\n\\nª 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The high correlation between spectral bands and vegetation parameters provides information for biomass estimation over a wide area. Thus, remote sensing-based biomass estimation has attracted the interest of scientists [1 e 9]. To meet the growing needs of bioenergy, we concentrated on biomass yield from energy crops and site-specific management using remote sensing methods. This paper specifically addresses a few specific research questions in the bioenergy arena: What are potential crops for biomass as a source of bioenergy? Which biophysical properties of crops are relevant to biomass estimation? What are the potential remote sensing methods for estimating biomass? To address these questions, this paper is structured into the following sections: first, the potential of the biomass energy scenario in USA is discussed; second, we discuss concepts involved in remote sensing of energy crops; third, we review methods to estimate the biophysical properties of crops, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) and chlorophyll content. Finally, we attempt to identify the challenges and opportunities of remote sensing of energy crops for above-ground biomass feedstock estimation. Although several published studies have addressed energy crops, this study reviews methods for established crops and discusses important factors that might be specifically applicable to energy crops.\\n\\n## 2. Biomass energy scenario\\n\\nBiomass represents the most promising renewable energy resource, and it is considered to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels [10,11]. Energy crops have the potential to enhance energy security in regions without abundant fossil fuel reserves, to increase supplies of transportation fuels and to decrease net emissions (per unit of energy delivered) of carbon into the atmosphere [12]. Biomass energy has historically been the world's dominant energy source [13], and has recently become even more important. Biomass contributes 7% of primary energy consumption, or roughly one third of the energy from sources other than fossil fuels [14]. The other two largest sources of non-fossil fuel energy (each contributing as muchenergy as biomass) are nuclear and hydroelectric power [15]. Renewable sources, such as wind and solar, currently contribute less than 1% to the global energy demand [15]. A joint study by the USDA and the DOE estimated that 1 /C2 10 9 dry tons of biomass will be required annually to meet AEI renewable energy targets [16]. Perennial energy crops could contribute, without disruption of food production, to meet the huge requirement for biomass that is not currently available fromUSagricultural and forest land. Assuming key changes in current practices, 1.366 /C2 10 9 dry tons of biomass could be available by 2030 without impacting food production [16]. Forest residue could potentially contribute 368 million tons. In addition, 998 million tons could be generated from 181 million hectares of agricultural land. From this agricultural land, 377 million tons could come from the conversion of 24 million hectares of active and currently fallow US farm land to cultivation of perennial energy crops [16]. Thus, 38% of the required biomass could be produced from the conversion of\\n\\n13% of agricultural land to perennial energy crops. Potential sources of biomass feedstock include corn stover, Miscanthus, switch grass and prairie grass. The DOE has chosen switch grass as a model energy crop, whereas the European research community has focused on Miscanthus. Brazil and South Africa are focusing on bioenergy production from sugarcane. Such biomass feedstock production contributes to the total amount of required biomass. Monitoring these energy crops therefore becomes a challenge to ensure maximal yield to meet the growing needs of biomass production. In the interval between planting and harvesting, site-specific management can help to maximize biomass yield from energy crops.\\n\\n## 3. Concepts of biomass energy crop monitoring\\n\\nRemote sensing allows information to be obtained from a target crop by measuring the intensity of electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted from the plants. An optical sensor can detect light from beyond the visible wavelengths into the infrared. By assessing the reflectance of various wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum, a 'spectral signature' of a crop can be established. Such a signature depends on the characteristics and conditions of a given crop; because soil reflectance is distinctly different from plant reflectance (Fig. 1a), such differences of reflectance between plants and soil can be used as a criterion to subtract soil background from plants [17]. The absence of a green peak is one feature that distinguishes soil from plants, whereas reflectance from soil in the near-infrared region is much lower than plant reflectance. Plant reflectance in the red region is equal to or higher than the near-infrared region for soil, and near-infrared reflectance of plants is higher than the red reflectance [18]. Fig. 1(b e c) shows the spectral response from Miscanthus in the fourth perennial growth stage at the Soyaface Farm, and first year perennial growth at the Energy Farm University of Illinois.\\n\\nBiophysical properties, such as vegetative growth, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic intercepted radiation, are important factors for biomass feedstock. The proper monitoring of energy crops will aid in estimation of such biophysical properties, and remote sensing methods possess advantages of real-time monitoring. The challenges and opportunities of these systems are depicted in Fig. 2. The following sections review the major biophysical properties that directly influence the yield of biomass.\\n\\n## 3.1. Vegetative indices\\n\\nVegetative Indices (VI) have been developed to understand canopy variables and to serve as the basis for many applications of remote sensing for crop management because they are correlated with several important biophysical properties, such as LAI. VI provides different indices of a crop. For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is computed from the near infrared and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and provides a measure of absorption of red light by plant chlorophyll as well as the reflection of infrared radiation by water-filled cells. Phenology\\n\\nFig. 1 e (a) Corn and soil reflectance in visible and NIR regions [17]; (b) Miscanthus spectral response for 4th year perennial growth at the Soyface farm, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; (c) Miscanthus spectral response for 1st year perennial growth at the energy farm, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; (d) Switch grass spectral response for 1st year perennial growth at the energy farm, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nand vigor are the main factors affecting NDVI. Some proposed VIs [19] and their application to crop canopies are listed in Table 1. LAI, chlorophyll content, and Fraction of Intercepted Photo-synthetically Active Radiation (fIPAR) [20] are important biophysical characteristics of crops that are used to estimate the primary production of biomass. At the canopy level, a change of canopy reflectance occurs more in the nearinfrared wavelengths throughout the growing season. Changing of reflectance occurs due to the increase of biomass. Development of VIs related to the ratio of near infrared (800 nm) to red (675 nm) reflectance [21] are calculated for biomass and LAI. A Difference Vegetative Index (DVI) proposed as near infrared to detect changes in mature vegetation over large areas and the VIs could be effectively used for large scale assessment of crop canopies [22]. Information about the vegetation water content has wide spread utility in agriculture and forestry. Research showed that the Normalized difference Moisture or Water Index NDMI or NDWI based on landsat TM near and middle infrared bands was highly correlated with canopy water content and more closely tracked changes in plant biomass and water stress than did the NDVI. The leaf water content Index (LWCI) can be used to asses water stress in leaves. The time series analysis of seasonal NDVI data have provided a method of estimating net primary production over varying biomass type of monitoring phonological patterns of the earth's vegetated surface and of assessing the length of growing season [37,38]. Although the NDVI has been shown to be useful in estimating vegetation properties, many important, external and internal influences restrict its global utility. The improved indices typically incorporate a soil background and/or atmospheric adjustment factor, called Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI).\\n\\n## 3.2. Chlorophyll content\\n\\nCrop nutrient requirements can be estimated from chlorophyll concentration [42], and remote sensing tools have been constructed on the principal that pigment content strongly affects leaf absorption spectra [19]. With increased chlorophyll content, visible wavelength absorption increases more\\n\\nFig. 2 e Concepts of energy crop monitoring and solutions to research questions for biomass feedstock production.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nthan 90% in the blue (400 e 500 nm) region. Chlorophylls a and b , as well as carotenoids, absorb in the red ( w 670 nm) region. For the green ( w 550 nm) and red edge ( w 700 nm) regions, the absorption coefficient of chlorophyll extracts is very low, and seldom exceeds 6% of the values for blue and red [43]; however, green leaves absorb more than 80% of incident light in these spectral ranges [28,44 e 47]. The common spectral features of leaf absorption and reflectance are: (i) minimum sensitivity to pigment content in the blue between 400 and 500 nm and in the NIR (ii) both absorption and reflectance of leaves with moderate to high chlorophyll are essentially insensitive to chlorophyll content in the red absorption band of chlorophyll a near 670 nm (iii) the green and red chlorophyll retrieval are not based on chlorophyll maximum absorption wavelengths. Indices composed of chlorophyll maximum absorption wavelengths would rapidly saturate, even with low chlorophyll concentrations [19]. RS spectral data for chlorophyll content provides information about the nutrient requirements of crops.\\n\\n## 3.3. LAI and PAR\\n\\nThe effects of crop stress due to nutrient deficiency are temporal and difficult to predict [48,49] and N content may promote changes in the VIs as a function of fIPAR instead of LAI. A plant converts only 0.1% of solar energy into biomass [50]. To assess the biomass of Miscanthus, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR 400 e 700 nm) is recorded. Light interception is determined by the fraction of light measured below the canopy compared with that measured above the canopy. The yield of biomass is related to PAR and the peak annual above-ground biomass. The intercepted radiation is converted to the above-ground biomass, and the energy per unit biomass is assumed to be 18 MJ kg /C0 1 [51,52]. The relations between LAI, fIPAR and dry matter can be used to predict the energy content from biomass. Ground-based remote sensing helps to acquire values for the intercepted radiation.\\n\\n## 3.4. Soil nutrients\\n\\nEarly and rapid detection of crop stress is crucial for taking appropriate remedial measures before any damage becomes irreversible. Nutrition status and crop stress information extraction based on vegetation indices have been reported [53 e 56]. Site-specific management can greatly benefit from information on spatial and temporal variability in crop growth patterns. Crop monitoring not only improves control of temporal variation in crop growth, but also provides information on crop development that is useful in developing managementstrategies to improve nutrient use efficiency [49]. Many studies have suggested the use of remotely sensed canopy reflectance for locating variability in the field. Vegetation indices such as NDVI and GNDVI derived from SPOT images have a high correlation with corn nitrogen stress [57]. An aerial image obtained at a wavelength of 550 nm is particularly informative to a corn canopy. N levels and a map of nitrogen deficiency have been generated for a cornfield using aerial images [53]. In another study, a mapping of weed infestation has been developed to guide real-time spray or onspray decisions [58]. Multi-spectral airborne and satellite data have been also used to map soil textural classes on a field-byfield basis [59]. Statistical models have been developed to assess nitrogen stress in different corn hybrids. In this regard, correlation analysis and the correlation and regression tree method have been implemented to identify field variability factors that affect the spatial grain yield in wheat [60]. Again, digitized color-infrared photographs have been used to classify weeds in a no-till corn field and to develop prescription maps for herbicide application [61]. Despite the varying colors of different corn hybrids, a model was able to predict nitrogen stress with high accuracy [55]. Most of the above-mentioned studies were based on limited remote sensing images collected during the growing season; however, temporal effects were not addressed. Monitoring the variability of crop growth during the early growth season corrects for possible\\n\\nTable 1 e Summary of selected vegetation indices, wavebands, applications, and citations.\\n\\nG: Gross primary productivity, TM4 and TM5 are the Tasseled cap coeefiecnets for use with Landsat 7 ETM Plus data (Huang et al., 2002).\\n\\n| Index                                      | Wavebands                                                                                                | Application                                   | Reference   |\\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|\\n|                                            | R 800 /C0 R 600 R 800 /C0 R 550                                                                          | biomass biomass                               | [20] [23]   |\\n| Simple Ratio                               | R NIR = R red                                                                                            | biomass, LAI, cover                           | [20,24]     |\\n| Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index        | WDRVI ¼ 0 : 1 R NIR /C0 R red = 0 : 1 R NIR þ R red                                                      | LAI, vegetation cover, biomass                | [25]        |\\n| Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetative Index | TSAVI ¼ a ð R NIR /C0 aR red /C0 b Þ = R red þ aR NIR /C0 ab                                             | LAI, biomass                                  | [26]        |\\n| Enhanced Vegetation Index                  | EVI ¼ 2 : 5 ð R NIR /C0 R red Þ = R NIR þ 6 R red /C0 7 : 5 R blue þ 1                                   | LAI, biomass                                  | [27]        |\\n| Green NDVI                                 | R NIR /C0 R green = R NIR þ R green                                                                      | intercepted PAR, vegetation cover             | [23,28,29]  |\\n| Red Edge NDVI                              | R NIR /C0 R rededge = R NIR þ R rededge                                                                  | intercepted PAR, vegetation cover             | [28]        |\\n| Visible Atmospherically Resistant Indices  | VARI green ¼ R green /C0 R red = R green þ R red                                                         | green vegetation fraction                     | [30]        |\\n| Chlorophyll Indices                        | VARI rededge ¼ R rededge /C0 R red = R rededge þ R red                                                   | green vegetation fraction                     | [30]        |\\n|                                            | CI green ¼ R NIR = R green /C0 1                                                                         | LAI, G: Chlorophyll green vegetation fraction | [31,32]     |\\n| Normalized Difference Moisture Index       | ¼ /C0 NDMI ¼ NIR TM4 /C0 MidIR TM5 = NIR TM4 þ MidIR TM5                                                 | Vegetation water content                      | [33 e 35]   |\\n| Leaf Water Content Index (LWCI)            | LWCI ¼ /C0 log ½ 1 /C0 ð NIR TM4 /C0 MidIR TM5 Þ/C138 = /C0 log ½ 1 /C0 ð NIR TM4ft /C0 MidIR TM5 Þ/C138 | Water stress                                  | [36]        |\\n| Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index             | SAVI ¼ ð 1 þ 0 : 5 Þð R NIR /C0 R red Þ = R NIR þ R red þ L                                              | Biomass, soil background                      | [39 e 41]   |\\n\\nabnormalities. The remote sensing data presented in Fig. 3 show the seasonal trajectories of vegetative growth as NDVI to demonstrate temporal and spatial variations in the cornfield.\\n\\n## 3.5. Water stress\\n\\nAnnual rainfall and water retention strongly influence the yields of feedstock. Feedstock such as Miscanthus possesses good water efficiency when considered on the basis of the amount of water required per unit of biomass. Achieving a high yield of biomass feedstock requires more water than the crops it replaces. In addition, a dense canopy means that 20 e 30% of the rainfall is intercepted, evaporates off or infiltrates into the soil. Limited soil water availability during the growing season results in a reduction of biomass feedstock yield. The total range over which a plant temperature varies due to soil water availability is dependent upon the evaporative demand of the atmosphere as well as on crop-specific transmission characteristics [62]. The thermal infrared region is more sensitive to acute water stress than is reflectance in the visible, NIR or SWIR wavelengths. However, the reflective portion of the spectrum and VIs also respond to plant water stress producing a change in canopy architecture, such as wilting or leaf rolling [63,64]; furthermore, whenever there is chronic water stress that slows growth, there is a reduction of green leaf index [65,66]. Again, thermal plant water stress indices typically provide adequate lead time for scheduling irrigations in regions where supplemental water is needed to grow crops. However, thermal indices can overestimate water stress when canopy cover is incomplete and sensors view a combination of cool plants and warm soil temperature [62].\\n\\nRemote sensing from aircraft, satellites or ground-based approaches have been able to provide information on water stress, crop water requirements, and crop evapotranspiration with varying degrees of accuracy.\\n\\n## 3.6. Salinity stress\\n\\nSalts in soil represent an important factor that limits productivity in many crop lands [67]. Remedial solutions require mapping of affected areas over space and time, which can be accomplished using remote sensing measurements. The change in reducing biomass or changes in the spectral properties of plants can reveal salt accumulation in affected areas [68 e 71].\\n\\n## 4. Remote sensing methods for monitoring energy crop\\n\\nBiophysical properties of energy crops can be estimated using space-borne, airborne or ground-based multispectral remote sensing methods. Multispectral remote sensing systems records reflected or emitted energy from an object of area of interest in multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and hyper-spectral remote sensing systems record data in hundreds of bands. The remote sensing system first detects electromagnetic energy that exits from the phenomena of interests and passes through the atmosphere. The energy detected is recorded as analog signal, which is usually converted to digital value through an analog to digital conversion. If an aircraft platform is used, the digital data are simply returned to earth while a spacecraft platform, the digital data\\n\\nFig. 3 e Seasonal trajectories of NDVI in 2004 and 2006 [17].\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nare telemeter to earth receiving station via tracking and data rely satellites (TDRS). In either case, it may be necessary to perform some radiometric and/or geometric preprocessing of the digital remotely sensed data to improve its interpretability. Biophysical and/or land cover information extracted using visual or digital image processing is distributed and used to make decisions [72]. There are variety of digital multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing systems and are organized according to the type of remote sensing technology used for vegetation and earth resource mapping (Table 2). Spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions represent the major criteria for selection of the most appropriate remote sensing method for site-specific management. The following sections highlight the various sensing methods that are used to estimate the biophysical properties of crops.\\n\\n## 4.1. Satellite imagery\\n\\nThe advantages of satellite imagery include the large areas that can be captured in a single image and the fact that information can be updated regularly to monitor changes. The method is more cost-effective when high resolution is not essential. Furthermore, non-visible spectrum wave bands can yield additional information on crop conditions. The most frequently used medium spatial resolution (10 e 100 m) data are from time series Landsat satellite imagery for biomass estimation at the local and regional scales [2,4,5,73 e 77]. Landsat 5 TM and SPOT 2 images have been analyzed with reference to a national forest inventory to estimate the current and future forest fuels in two areas of Sweden [78]. An investigation of sugarcane growing areas in South Africa was conducted using LANDSAT TM images [79]. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), SPOT VEGETATION and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are on-board satellites that have coarse (greater than\\n\\n100 m) spatial resolution (Table 3). NOAA captures images in five channels: two infrared, one red and two thermal bands. Such images have been used to derive a standard vegetation index NDVI for sugarcane in three regions of South Africa [80]. Ten-day NDVI values were accumulated over periods representing the growth cycle of each harvest year crop. The resulting index of accumulated NDVI was compared with the observed mill and farm yields to detect correlations [80]. A close correlation would imply that the NOAA satellite could be used operationally to improve crop estimates. This research revealed interesting patterns in NDVI as measured by the NOAA-AVHRR sensor over a period from 1988 to 1998. Significant correlations between average sugarcane yield over a mill area and NDVI were obtained for five of the nine sampled areas. Correlation between farm yield records and NDVI was generally worse than that for mill yield records. AVHRR data have been the primary source of large area surveys and the most extensively used datasets for studies of vegetation dynamics at the continental scale [9]. NOAA-AVHRR data processing was used to map vegetation over Sao-Paulo state in southeast of Brazil for both wheat and sugarcane. The vegetation fraction component values strongly correlated with NDVI values and compared favorably with Landsat TM images [81]. The close relationship between middle infrared (MIR) reflectance and above-ground biomass implies that MIR reflectance may be more sensitive to changes in forest properties than reflectance at invisible and near-infrared wavelengths [82]. AVHRR NDVI data have been analyzed to estimate biomass density and to assess burned areas, burned biomass and atmospheric emissions in Africa [83]. SPOT VEGETATION data with 1 /C2 1 km spatial resolution was used to estimate above-ground biomass in Canada [84]. Since MODIS data are readily available, the large number of spectral bands may be beneficial to the improvement of AGB estimation accuracy at the continental or global scale.

Biologically available biomass was estimated from MODIS/Terra remote sensing data to evaluate the feasibility of setting up new biomass power plants and to optimize the locations of plants in Guandong, China [86]. The amount of biomass that is usable for energy production was then derived using a model that incorporated factors such as vegetation type, economical competition and harvest cost. The study recommended several most optimal locations for setting up new biomass power plants in the Guandong province with GIS\\n\\npresentations. In another study, the global potential for bioenergy on abandoned agriculture lands was estimated to be less than 8% of current primary energy demand, based on historical land use data and satellite-derived MODIS/Terra Land Cover types data [87]. Overall, biomass estimation using coarse spatial resolution data are still very limited because of the common occurrence of mixed pixel size in the image, which makes it difficult to integrate sample data and remote sensing derived variables. Fine spatial resolution data are usually less than 5 m and can be obtained from Quickbird and IKONOS images. Considerable effort has been made to extract biophysical parameters using fine spatial resolution. IKONOS high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images have been used to extract uniformity information from a vineyard to provide decision support to the vineyard management [88]. Estimation of above-ground biomass using IKONOS data in Africa has also been reported. The major drawbacks of fine spatial resolution satellite data include 1) the lack of a short infrared image, which is often required for above-ground biomass estimation, 2) the large amount of data storage required and 3) the time required for image processing [89]. Overall, satellite-based remote sensing faces problems of high temporal resolution due to longer satellite re-visit times, total cost, cloud cover and limited spatial resolution [90]. Due to these limitations, the space-borne remote sensing platform is not suitable for site-specific management.\\n\\n## 4.2. Aerial photography\\n\\nAerial photographs are most useful when fine spatial detail is more critical than spectral information, since the spectral resolution of such images is generally more coarse than data captured with electronic sensing devices. The geometry of vertical photographs is well understood, and it is possible to make very accurate measurements from them for a variety of applications in geology, forestry and mapping. The science of making measurements from photographs is called photogrammetry, which has been performed extensively since the very beginnings of aerial photography. Presently, aerial hyperspectral images are available for agricultural remote sensing [91,92]. A hyperspectral image has more bands (tens to hundreds) with a narrow band (one to several nanometers) in the same spectral range as a multispectral image [93].\\n\\n| Table 3 e Major satellite imagery sensor's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions.   | Table 3 e Major satellite imagery sensor's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions.   | Table 3 e Major satellite imagery sensor's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions.               | Table 3 e Major satellite imagery sensor's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions.   |\\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Sensors                                                                                  | Spatial resolution                                                                       | Spectral resolution                                                                                  | Temporal resolution                                                                      |\\n| AVHRR                                                                                    | 1.1 and 4 km; Swath width 2400 km                                                        | 4 or 5 bands (0.58 e 0.68, 0.725 e 1.1, 3.55 e 3.93, 10.3 e 11.3, 11.5 e 12.5 m m)                   | 12 h day, 1 night                                                                        |\\n| Landsat TM                                                                               | 30 m; Swath width 185 km                                                                 | 7 bands (0.45 e 0.52, 0.52 e 0.6, 0.63 e 0.69, 0.76 e 0.9, 1.55 e 1.75, 10.4 e 12.5, 2.08 e 2.3 m m) | 16 days                                                                                  |\\n| SPOT                                                                                     | 10 mP/20 mX; Pushbroom 60 km                                                             | P-1 band (0.51 e 0.73 m m); X-3 bands (0.5 e 0.59, 0.61 e 0.68, 0.79 e 0.89 m m)                     | 26 days                                                                                  |\\n| IRSI                                                                                     | 5.8 m; Pushbroom 70 km                                                                   | 1 band (0.5 e 0.75 m m)                                                                              | 22 days                                                                                  |\\n| IKONOS                                                                                   | 1 mP/4m X; Pushbroom 11 km                                                               | P-1 band (0.45 e 0.9 m m); X-4 bands (0.44 e 0.51, 0.52 e 0.60, 0.63 e 0.70, 0.76 e 0.85 m m)        | 1 e 2 days                                                                               |\\n| Quickbird                                                                                | 0.6 e 1m P/2.5 e 4m X; 16 e 21 km                                                        | P-1 band (0.45 e 0.9 m m); X-4 bands; (0.45 e 0.52, 0.52 e 0.60,0.63 e 0.69, 0.76 e 0.90 m m)        | 1 e 2 days                                                                               |\\n| MODIS                                                                                    | 250, 500, 1000 m; Pushbroom 2330 km                                                      | 36 bands (0.405 e 14.385 m m)                                                                        | 2 days                                                                                   |\\n\\nHyperspectral data provide more detailed information from images [91]; for example, airborne hyperspectral images provide sufficiently high spatial resolution to create maps and characterize soil fertility [94]. Information on the location and extent of sugarcane cultivation is important to the sugar industry, and while field maps are available for most farms, they are generally not available in a computerized or digital form. Digital maps allow the use of a GIS to determine cane areas falling within a selected region. Accurate digital field maps are prepared from GPS surveys, digital orthophotos or by digitizing field boundaries. VI developed from three bands Color Infra Red (CIR) images identified weeding density in the field [95]. In the South African sugar industry, the currently preferred method for accurate field mapping utilizes digital orthophotos. A digital orthophoto comprises a series of aerial photographs that have been mathematically stretched and joined to produce a single computerized photograph that is accurate in latitude and longitude as well as in elevation [96]. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based agricultural remote sensing system to provide a maximum flexibility in crop image collection [97]. The benefits of UAVs mainly lie in the ease, rapidity and cost of flexibility of deployment that lends itself to many land surface measurement and monitoring applications. The past 5 years have seen a steady flow of high quality peer-review papers and research theses on remote sensing from UAV platforms for innovative applications. Several researches have been conducted about the unmanned UAV systems: Thermal and multispectral sensors for estimating water stress in fruit crops [98]; forestry and agriculture [99]; mapping of knapweed in Utah rangelands [100]; biomass and nitrogen status of crops [101]; Rangeland Vegetation [102]. The UAV navigation system was controlled by the ground station, and navigated to reach the predefined waypoints [17]. High altitude UAV platforms offer opportunities for innovative atmospheric science (primarily) while small, low-altitude systems are ideal for monitoring of crops, coastal algal blooms, riparian and rangeland vegetation and even for photogrammetric and laser scanning. However the payload and engine operation time made the system inconvenient to carry long flight. In addition roll and pitch correction has to be considers to develop a ground base station for the UAV system for mission planning, flight command activation and flight monitoring.\\n\\n## 4.3. Radar and lidar\\n\\nSatellite imagery faces the problem of frequent cloud cover, which limits the acquisition of high quality remote sensing data. In this situation, the use of radar becomes a feasible means for acquiring remote sensing data in a given period of time. The radar system collects earth feature data irrespective of weather or light conditions [9]. Research has been conducted to estimate above-ground biomass using radar data [6,103 e 108]. But the saturation problem is also common in radar data: saturation level depends on the wavelength (different bands such as C, L, P), polarization (such as HV and VV), and the characteristics of vegetation structures and ground conditions. A longer wavelength (L-band) SAR image is more suitable for discriminating between different levels of forest biomass up to a certain threshold [109]. L band back scatter shows no sensitivity to increased biomass. Reasonably good results have been obtained when above-ground biomass was less than 40 tons per hectare [109] and 15 kg m /C0 2 [110] of biomass has been found. This indicates that radar can be used to estimate biomass in a regenerating forest in tropical regions. Again, landscape characteristics are one of the factors to estimate forest biomass from radar data [111]. Airborne radar has been implemented for forest estimation of such parameters as timber volume and tropical forest biomass [112 e 115]. Lidar data have been demonstrated to be a good approach to estimate the biophysical properties of a canopy [114,116,117]. Presently, lidar has been used to estimate forest biomass, temperate mixed deciduous forest biomass [118,119], tropical forest biomass [120], tree height, stand volume [113,121] and canopy structure [122]. In these airborne sensing methods, wavelength radar data have important roles in biomass estimation under conditions of frequent cloud cover. However, the data analysis requires pre-processing, and image processing requires skill and time. In addition, noise and temporal resolution are the major drawbacks in implementing space- and airborne remote sensing methods for site-specific management of energy crops. For site-specific management, near real-time data processing is required to adopt precision farming and to find the optimum window of harvesting biomass.\\n\\n## 4.4. Ground-based remote sensing\\n\\nGround-based remote sensing is becoming popular for sitespecific management. High resolution multispectral, hyperspectral digital cameras, spectrometers, and several other optical sensors have been introduced to measure reflectance data at different wavelengths. Instead of using film, digital cameras use a gridded array of silicon-coated CCDs (chargecoupled devices) that individually respond to electromagnetic radiation. Energy reaching the surface of the CCDs generates an electronic charge whose magnitude is proportional to the 'brightness' of the ground area. A digital number for each spectral band is assigned to each pixel based on the magnitude of the electronic charge. The digital format of the output image is amenable to both digital analysis and archiving in a computer, and hardcopy outputs are similar to regular photographs. Digital cameras also provide quicker turnaroundforacquisition and retrieval of data, and permit greater control of the spectral resolution. Although parameters vary, digital imaging systems are capable of collecting data with centimeter-scale spatial resolution. The size of the pixel arrays varies between systems, but typically ranges between 512 /C2 512 and 2048 /C2 2048. Multispectral and hyperspectral images are collections of several to hundreds of monochrome images of the same scene, each taken with a different sensor; each image is referred to as a band. Visible bands ranging 0.7 e 0.4 m m are called red e green e blue (RGB) regions, and infrared wavelengths of 0.7 e 1.0 m m or more are classified as NIR-NearInfrared, MIR-Middle Infrared and FIR-Far Infrared or Thermal. This technology allows one to extract additional information that the human eye cannot. Spectral imagers operate from various low-altitude stand-alone systems or balloons. In the last couple of years, airborne multispectral imagery, ground observations, GPS, GIS, image processing and\\n\\nFig. 4 e (a) Field view and tower camera sensing platform at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; (b) Camera housing, pan/tilt, lens controller and computer; (c) Geospatial MS4100 multispectral camera and customized lens.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nyield monitoring have been integrated to map spatial variations in cotton, grain sorghum, and corn plant growth and yield [123]. A multispectral image sensor has been used to detect nitrogen stress in cornfields, to determine application rates of fertilizer in real-time [124], and to assess yield variability of corn [69]. The results indicate that 34% of the high yield diversity occurred at the perimeter of the field. Over a wide range of management practices, crop yields were found to be significantly related to spectral bands and vegetation indices during the reproductive stages of development [125,126]. Furthermore, multispectral data have been used to locate water stress in cotton fields [127] and to predict fruit firmness using a multispectral image sensor [128]. Thus, the digital Multi-Spectral Video (DMSV) camera has become very attractive to the researcher. For example, a DMSV sensor has been used to assess the potential operational benefits of this technologytothesugarindustriesinSouthAfrica[80,129].This sensor system uses four wavebands of wavelengths: 0.45, 0.55, 0.65 and 0.75 m m.StandardVIcombinationsoffourwavebands are acquired to provide an index of vegetation reflectance. In ground-based sensing systems, image quality represents the major factor that directly impacts the final image processing results; especially under natural lighting conditions, image color varies significantly as lighting conditions are changed [130,131]. However, an artificial intelligence controller-based model can automatically adjust multispectral camera parameters, such as gain and exposure time, to compensate for changes in natural lighting conditions and to acquire whitebalanced images [132]. The stand-alone camera sensors systemshowninFig.4(a e b) consists of a multispectral camera (MS4100, GSI) a pan/tilt device, a receiver and a lens controller [133]. Image acquisition, rectification and automatic calibration with a white balance algorithm are integrated in the unit to achieve collection of the real-time RGB and CIR images shown in Fig. 5 for growing season of switch grass in the first year of perennial growth. This CIR image has been used to create NDVI map shown using ERDAS Imagine 9.3 (Leica Geosystem). This ongoing research project is focused on real-time remote sensing to determine crop growth, biophysical properties and harvest readiness of feedstock at the Energy Farm, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\\n\\n## 5. Software's availability for remote sensing\\n\\nIn recent years, with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, the obtainable remote sensing data has\\n\\nFig. 5 e CIR, RGB and NDVI Image of switch grass at the different stages of first year perennial growth.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nbeen increasing significantly. Besides the hardware and remote sensing platform, the software availability for analyzing and decoding of imagery is important. A good numbers of proprietary and open source application are available to decode remote sensing data (Table 4). Many of the researchers are using ERDAS Imagine with Leica Photogrammetric Suite (LPS) and ENVI to decode and analyze for geospatial data processing and production. Arc view Image Analysis has the advantage and compatibility with ERDAS and ENVI. Along with this researchers are using EDRISI, Earth, Autodesk, PCI geometica and open source software like GRSS and QGIS. Recently the web based applications also increasing to decode and analyze satellite remote sensing data. Currently Open Source Remote Sensing Software (OSRS) can be categorized into some types: full source codes, Application Programming Interface (API) and development libraries [134]. Furthermore, the open source software for geospatial information manipulation and processing is categorized in many types: desktop viewer, web client and server, middleware database management and file converter [135]. The open source software for geoprocessing and supporting Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard specifications and their uses [136,137]. It is known that OSSIM (Open Source Software Image Map: www.ossim.org) is a high performance software system for remote sensing, image processing, geographical information systems and photogrammetry. The open source project has been developed since the mid-1990s, being funded by several US government agencies in the intelligence and defense community. Designed as a series of high performance software libraries, it has been coded in C þþ employing the latest techniques in object oriented software design. As the second OSRS software, Opticks is open source software offerings to include new extensions that perform hyperspectral, multispectral and image spectroscopy analysis for forestry, agriculture, urban and cartography.\\n\\n## 6. Challenges and opportunities of feedstock production\\n\\nThe major challenges of remote sensing research are adoption of site-specific management, yield prediction and quality assurance of energy crops. Commercial high spatial resolution imagery from aircraft and satellites have low temporal resolution and are expensive; the costs may therefore outweigh the benefits of the information acquired [138]. Aerial photography from radio-controlled aircraft has been evaluated as a low-cost technology for assessing nutrient status, herbicide application and crop biomass estimation. Near real-time sensing from a ground-based system can provide high spatial and temporal resolution to adopt site-specific management of energy crop.\\n\\n| Table 4 e Major Softwares available for gathering remote sensing data and interpreting image in remote sensing applications.   | Table 4 e Major Softwares available for gathering remote sensing data and interpreting image in remote sensing applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| ERDAS IMAGINE                                                                                                                  | Geospatial mapping, visualization, enhancement and geo-correction and automatic DEM (digital elevation model) extraction of images                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\\n| ERMapper                                                                                                                       | Application in the orthorectification and digital imagery analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\\n| ENVI                                                                                                                           | Processing and analyzing geospatial imagery to get meaningful information from imagery.

Feedstock site-specific management\\n\\nThe challenges of growing feedstock are to maximize yield for remote-sensing research, to establish site-specific management for eradicating weeds and insect pests and to maximize environmental benefits. Pre-harvest estimates of plant productivity enable growers to delineate management zones [139] and to establish earlier and better site-specific management of energy crops. Near-real-time sensing and imagery facilitates precise and timely diagnosis of stress so that growers can take prompt remedial actions. Remote sensing tools identify seedling diseases or insect infestations for evaluation of the need to replant, to plan herbicide or fertilizer application and to interpret end-of-season yield maps. Stateof-the-art remote monitors from real-time sensing are required for weed control of perennial energy crops at the beginning of their growth. Poor control of weeds hinders the development of crops, and weeds compete with crops for light, water, and nutrients, ultimately reducing biomass yield. Because feedstock is a perennial crop, multispectral imagery taken shortly after emergence should be used to assess plant populations for management purposes.\\n\\n## 6.2. Feedstock yield prediction\\n\\nObservation of biomass at the end of the growing season helps to predict biomass production. Remote sensing approaches are able to forecast the total supply and demand of biomass throughout the country. Uncertainty of yield in some regions may occur, and planning can be done according to the demand of energy for each region. In addition, this approach will make growers confident about the final yield of biomass and help them to assess the spatial variations of yield across the field. This approach provides temporal information on growth rates as well as plant responses to dynamic weather conditions. There are few approaches for biomass yield predictions. Multiple regression analysis is an approach for biomass estimation. Changes in above-ground biomass are not directly revealed from changes in reflectance. Optical sensors provide canopy information, and models of canopy reflectance are more suitable to estimate foliage and woody biomass [3,140]. The availability of aircraft-based sensor systems and the potential for obtaining data several times during a growing season helps researchers to generate yield maps of large areas [123]. In other approaches, temporal remote sensing models have been used to predict crop yield based on stress. Crops exposed to higher levels of water stress during the growing season had the highest cumulative thermal stress and the lowest yields [62]. Frequent spectral reflectance has been coupled with thermal observations to predict yields of wheat and grain sorghum [141]. This method was found to be a good estimator of crop yield with a magnitude error (less than 10%) comparable to that observed in repeated small sampling across large fields. Accuracy assessment is an important parameter in the biomass estimation procedure. Two methods are often used to evaluate model performance. The first is based on the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) if the models are developed using multiple regression analysis. The second is used to assess the root mean-squared error (RMSE). In general, a high R 2 or low RMSE\\n\\nvalue often indicates a good model. In general, the assessment of biomass estimation can be obtained at different levels, such as the per pixel level, the per field level, the polygon level or the total area [9]. Energy content can be estimated from the dry matter of the energy crop. This projection helps to identify supply and demand of bioenergy from biomass feedstock.\\n\\n## 6.3. Feedstock quality assurance\\n\\nThe critical factor for energy crops is the moisture content of biomass feedstocks. A drier feedstock has a higher energy yield than a wet feedstock. Remote measurement of water content and optimum scheduling can ensure the biomass quality and energy content of feedstocks. To ensure the quality of the data, high resolution, near-real-time standalone ground-based remote sensing can help to collect data year-round. Minimum spatial resolution requires 1 m per pixel for multispectral or hyperspectral images in order to estimate the spatial variability of moisture content, which determines the quality of dry matter and energy content of the biomass feedstock.\\n\\n## 7. Conclusions\\n\\nThe remote sensing data of spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions offers unique opportunities for analyzing biophysical properties of energy crops. These biophysical properties and the harvest readiness of feedstock from energy crops require real-time sensing. Ground-based remote sensing can be adopted for acquisition of near-real-time information of energy crops over the plant growing season. Ground-based time series imagery could be combined with crop calendars, precipitation records and yield monitoring for site-specific management. A geo-referenced map from ground-based sensing has many advantages for locating spatial variations in water stress, salinity, nitrogen deficiency or pest infestation. In addition, future bioenergy demands require the information of large-scale production of biomass feedstock in advance. The remote-sensed satellite imagery will help the resource planner to utilize and optimize bioenergy production and distribution throughout the country using spatially predicted yield.\\n\\nr e f e r e n c e s\\n\\n- [1] Nelson R, Krabill W, Tonelli J.

      "Ниже — сжатое структурированное описание по индексу MD734/747/715/720 (полное название в текстах: Modified Normalized Difference 734/747/715/720), собранное из приведённых статей (в частности: Vogelmann et al., Gitelson et al., Le Maire et al.).\n",
      "\n",
      "1) На что указывает этот индекс\n",
      "- Это вегетационный индекс, чувствительный к содержанию хлорофилла (общему Chl a+b) листа/покрова — он основан на сигналах в «красном крае» (red edge).  \n",
      "- Конкретно сочетает отражения в окрестностях 734–747 nm и 715–720 nm (популярная реализация — соотношение/модифицированное нормированное соотношение этих полос), что подчёркивает сдвиг и форму red‑edge, связанный с изменением содержания хлорофилла.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Как его интерпретировать\n",
      "- Формула (как приводится в обзоре/таблицах): примерно MD734/747/715/720 ≈ (R734 / R747) / (R715 + R720) или, в близкой постановке, отношение среднего отражения в диапазоне ~734–747 nm к среднему отражению в диапазоне ~715–720 nm (варианты реализации встречаются в литературе).  \n",
      "- Интерпретация: более высокое значение индекса обычно соответствует большему содержанию хлорофилла (индекс возрастает при «подъёме» NIR‑плато относительно красного края). Индекс используется как количественный предиктор общего хлорофилла листа/покрова.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Точность и ограничения\n",
      "- Оценка точности (по таблицам Le Maire et al., 2004): при проверке на экспериментальной выборке RMSECV ≈ 3.12 (ед. в статье — µg/cm^2 (Ag/cm^2)); при тесте на смоделированной базе RMSE ≈ 3.98 µg/cm^2; в обзоре согласие экспериментальных и смоделированных данных для этого индекса оценивается как хорошее (++). Также Vogelmann et al. и Moss & Rock отмечали высокую корреляцию аналогичных соотношений с общим хлорофиллом.  \n",
      "- Ограничения и факторы, снижающие надёжность:  \n",
      "  - Требуется узкополосная (гиперспектральная) спектроскопия с хорошим спектральным разрешением и калибровкой (узкие смещения полос сильно влияют на значение).  \n",
      "  - Чувствителен к структуре листа/канопли, виду растений, отношению Chl a/Chl b и каротиноидам — для разных видов/архитектур может потребоваться перекалибровка.  \n",
      "  - На уровне кроны/съёмки из воздуха/спутника добавляются атмосферные и фоново‑геометрические эффекты (атмосфера, угол освещения/наблюдения, фон почвы), которые ухудшают переносимость листных калибровок на канопу.  \n",
      "  - В диапазоне больших концентраций хлорофилла возможна «сатиурация» и эффект «прыжка/многоч峰ности» red‑edge (peak‑jump), что может менять поведение индекса; этим объясняют частые рекомендации комбинировать несколько полос или использовать модифицированные индексы.  \n",
      "  - Модельные погрешности: при использовании радиативно‑переносных моделей (PROSPECT) были замечены расхождения по некоторым длинам волн; это означает, что индексы, калиброванные только на модели, могут дать смещённые оценки.\n",
      "\n",
      "Короткий практический вывод: MD734/747/715/720 — рабочий узкополосный индекс для оценки содержания хлорофилла через признаки red‑edge; на листовом уровне даёт умеренно точные оценки (порядок погрешности несколько µg/cm^2 по приведённым тестам), но требует гиперспектральных измерений и аккуратной перекалибровки/коррекции при переносе между видами, уровнями (лист → покров) и платформами.\n"
