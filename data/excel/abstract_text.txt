## Abstract

Crop biomass can be evaluated from radiometric measurements either by relating biomass to instantaneous measurements or by relating an integral of biomass to a radiometric value integrated over the corresponding portion of the growth period.

In this study, the success obtained by using these two methods is discussed. A simple radiative transfer model was used in conjunction with experimental results to demonstrate the universality of the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (_ND_) and leaf area index (_LAI_) or the photosynthetically active radiation (_PAR_) absorbed by the crop. It shows that the relationship between _ND_ and absorbed _PAR_ is less dependent on leaf orientation than the relationship between _ND_ and _LAI_. A remaining problem is the sensitivity of those two relationships to soil optical properties. Nevertheless, temporal integration of radiometric data using the absorbed PAR concept appears to be a more promising approach than one-time measurements.

## Abstract

Red and photographic infrared data were collected with a hand-held radiometer under a variety of conditions at 4- to 12-day intervals throughout the growing season and were used to monitor corn and soybean growth and development. The normalized difference transformation was used to effectively compensate for the variation in irradiational conditions. With these data, plotted against time, green-leaf biomass dynamics were compared between the crops. By this approach, based entirely upon spectral inputs, the crop canopies were nondestructively monitored. Five spectral stages were defined and were related to crop development for corn and soybeans.

## Abstract

Numerous formulae, vegetation indices, have been developed to reduce multispectral scanner (MSS) data to a single number for assessing vegetation characteristics such as species, leaf area, stress, and biomass. Part I of this report gives the history and formulae of some four dozen vegetation indices. Studies investigating the empirical relationships among vegetation indices are summarized. Part II of this report develops the idea of two vegetation indices being functionally equivalent: Two vegetation indices are taken to be equivalent for making a set of decisions, if the decisions made on the basis of one index could have been equally well made on the basis of the other index. The utility of these ideas is explored in the context of alarm models and graphical displays. Several widely used indices are shown to be equivalent.

## Abstract

From basic considerations and Beer's law, a leaf water content index incorporating reflectances of wavelengths from 0.76 to 0.90 μm and from 1.55 to 1.75 μm (Landsat Thematic Mapper Bands TM4 and TM5, respectively) was developed that relates leaf reflectance to leaf relative water content. For the leaf succulent, _Agave deserti_, the leaf water content index was not significantly different from the relative water content for either individual leaves or an entire plant. Also, the relative water contents of intact plants of _Encelia farinosa_ and _Hilaria rigida_ in the field were estimated by the leaf water content index; variations in the proportion of living to dead leaf area could cause large errors in the estimate of relative water content. Thus, the leaf water content index may be able to estimate average relative water content of canopies when TM4 and TM5 are measured at a known relative water content and fraction of dead leaf material.

## Abstract

An atmospheric radiant transfer model was used to compare ground-measured radiances over partially vegetated canopies with their simulated responses at the top of a clear (100 km meteorological range) and a turbid (10 km) atmosphere. Radiance measurements in the first four bands of the Thematic Mapper were taken over incomplete cotton (_Gossypium hirsutum L._) and Lehmann lovegrass (_Eragrostis lehmanniana_ Nees) canopies with different soil backgrounds separately inserted underneath. Atmospheric influences on the spectra of partial canopies were found to be significantly dependent on the “brightness” of the underlying soil. The change in canopy red and near-infrared radiance between the ground and the top of the atmosphere was such that an increase, decrease, or no change could be observed, depending on the magnitude of the canopy substrate contribution. Both increasing soil “brightness” and atmospheric turbidity lowered the ratio (RVI) and normalized difference vegetation index values (NDVI). Consequently, atmospheric-induced RVI and NDVI degradation were greatest over canopies with darker soils and were not detectable over canopies with light-colored soils. In contrast, soil and atmospheric effects on the perpendicular vegetation index were independent with atmosphere degradation being similar across all soil backgrounds. Soil influences on vegetation indices from partial canopies were found to be of similar magnitude to those attributed to the atmosphere for the range of soil and atmosphere conditions examined here.

## Abstract

Detection of plant water stress by remote sensing has been proposed using indices of Near-Infrared (NIR, 0.7–1.3 μm) and Middle-Infrared (MIR, 1.3–2.5 μm) wavelengths. The first objective of this study was to test the ability of the Leaf Water Content Index (LWCI) to determine leaf Relative Water content (RWC) of different species with different leaf morphologies. The second objective was to determine how the Moisture Stress Index (MSI; MIR / NIR) varies with RWC and the Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). Reflectance factors at 0.82 μm and 1.6 μm were measured on leaves of _Quercus agrifolia_ (sclerophyllous leaves), _Liquidambar styraciflua_ (hardwood deciduous tree leaves), _Picea rubens_ and _Picea pungens_ (conifer needles), and _Glycine max_ (herbaceous dicot leaves) as they dried on a laboratory bench. RWC and EWT were measured concurrently with the reflectance measurements. The results showed that LWCI was equal to RWC for the species tested. However, the results of a sensitivity analysis indicated the reflectances at 1.6 μm for two different RWC must be known for accurate prediction of unknown RWC; thus the LWCI is impractical for field applications. MSI was linearly correlated to RWCwith each species having a different regression equation and to log10 EWT with data of all species falling on the same regression line. Because EWT is correlated with leaf area index, MSI should also be correlated with leaf area index. Assuming that the linear regression equation of MSI to EWT can be applied to canopies, then the minimum significant change of RWC that can be detected is 52%. For most plants, the natural variation in RWC from water stress is only about 20%, so that we conclude that indices derived from NIR and MIR reflectances cannot be used to remotely-sense water stress

## Abstract

Remotely sensed data are being used to estimate foliar chemical content as a result of our need for the information and our increasing ability to understand and measure foliar spectra. This paper reviews how stepwise multiple regression and deconvolution have been used to extract chemical information from foliar spectra, and concludes that both methods are useful, but neither is ideal. It is recommended that the focus of research be modeling in the long term and experimentation in the short term. Long-term research should increase our understanding of the interaction between radiation and foliar chemistry so that the focus of research can move from leaf model to canopy model to field experiment. Short-term research should aim to design experiments in which remotely sensed data are used to generate unambiguous and accurate estimates of foliar chemical content.

## Abstract

The simplified reflectance model described earlier (Clevers, 1988b) for estimating leaf area index (LAI) is further simplified. In this model the nearinfrared reflectance was corrected for soil background (in particular differences in soil moisture content) and subsequently used for estimating LAI by applying the inverse of a special case of the Mitscherlich function. In the specific situation that the ratio of the reflectances of bare soil in the red and near-infrared is constant for a given soil background, the corrected near-infrared reflectance is now ascertained as a weighted difference of total measured near-infrared and red reflectances (socalled WDVI = weighted difference vegetation index). The validity of this approach is confirmed by simulations with the SAIL model. The above concept was tested at the experimental farm of the Agricultural University Wageningen, by using reflectance factors measured in field trials by means of multispectral aerial photography. The soil type at the experimental farm yielded constant ratios between green, red, and near-infrared reflectances independent of soil moisture content (that is, as a function of time). The difference between measured near-infrared and red reflectances provided a satisfactory approximation of the corrected near-infrared reflectance. The estimation of LAI by this corrected near-infrared reflectance for real field data yielded good results in this study, resulting in the ascertainment of treatment effects with larger precision than by means of the LAI measured in the field by conventional field sampling methods.

## Abstract

The near-infrared (NIR) versus red “infrared percentage vegetation index,” _NIR_/(_NIR_ + _Red_), is functionally and linearly equivalent to the normalized difference vegetation index, (_NIR_-_Red_/(_NIR_ + _Red_). Advantageously, it is both computationally faster and never negative.

## Abstract

We present a new “physiological reflectance index” (PRI) isolated from narrow waveband spectral measurements of sunflower canopies. This index correlates with the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and with the efficiency of photosynthesis in control and nitrogen stress canopies, but not in water stress canopies undergoing midday wilting. It is analogous in formulation to the broadband normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and uses reflectance at 531 nm and at a reference wavelength to minimize complications associated with diurnal sun angle changes. In conjunction with other methods, this index may lead to improved remote and ground-based estimates of canopy photosynthetic function.

## Abstract

We studied the reflectance spectra of the aquatic vegetation of Searsville Lake in coastal central California using a high spectral resolution hand-held spectroradiometer. The three aquatic types—submerged, floating, and emergent—exhibited clear differences in their spectral reflectance and can be distinguished on the basis of discriminant analysis using reflectance parameters. This technique can be used in large-area mapping of aquatic plants. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ratio (SR) were well correlated with chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and biomass in the emergent species. New, narrow-bandwidth indices and reflectance indices calculated from first and second derivative spectra were strongly correlated with the ratio of secondary and protective pigments to chlorophyll _a_ and with epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments, and therefore, with photosynthetic efficiency. These new indices may be useful in the remote sensing of plant physiological status.

## Abstract

For monitoring agricultural crop production, growth of crops is modeled, for example, by using simulation models. Estimates of crop growth often are inaccurate for practical field conditions. Therefore, model simulations must be improved by incorporating information on the actual growth and development of field crops, for example, by using remote sensing data. Such data can be used to initialize, calibrate, or update crop growth models, and it can yield parameter estimates to be used as direct input into growth models: 1) leaf area index (LAI), 2) leaf angle distribution (LAD), and 3) leaf colour (optical properties in the PAR region). LAI and LAD determine the amount of light interception. Leaf (or crop) color influences the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and the maximum (potential) rate of photosynthesis of the leaves. A framework is described for integrating optical remote sensing data from various sources in order to estimate the mentioned parameters. In this article, the above concepts for crop growth estimation are elucidated and illustrated using groundbased and airborne data obtained during the MAC Europe 1991 campaign. Quantitative information concerning both LAI and LAD was obtained by measurements at two viewing angles (using data from the CAESAR scanner in dual-look mode). The red edge index was used for estimating the leaf optical properties (using AVIRIS data). Finally, a crop growth model (SUCROS) was calibrated on time series of optical reflectance measurements to improve the estimation of crop yield.

## Abstract

There is currently a great deal of interest in the quantitative characterization of temporal and spatial vegetation patterns with remotely sensed data for the study of earth system science and global change. Spectral models and indices are being developed to improve vegetation sensitivity by accounting for atmosphere and soil effects. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was developed to minimize soil influences on canopy spectra by incorporating a soil adjustment factor _L_ into the denominator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) equation. For optimal adjustment of the soil effect, however, the _L_ factor should vary inversely with the amount of vegetation present. A modified SAVI (MSAVI) that replaces the constant _L_ in the SAVI equation with a variable _L_ function is presented in this article. The _L_ function may be derived by induction or by using the product of the NDVI and weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI). Results based on ground and aircraft-measured cotton canopies are presented. The MSAVI is shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a “vegetation signal” to “soil noise” ratio.

## Abstract

We followed diurnal and seasonal changes in physiology and spectral reflectance of leaves throughout the canopies of sunflower plants grown in control, nitrogen (N)-limited, and water-stressed plots. Leaves from control sunflower plants had significantly higher levels of nitrogen, chlorophyll (chl), ribulose bis phosphate carboxylase / oxygenase (RuBPCase) activity and photosynthetic rates and lower starch content and leaf thickness than N-limited plants. Water-stressed plants had the highest N and chl contents (on an area basis). They also had the lowest water potential and photosynthetic rates, in spite of maintaining high RuBPCase activities. Leaves from stressed plants (especially N-limited) had significantly higher reflectances in the visible wavelengths and lower in the near IR than leaves from control plants. The only clear trend across canopy levels was the higher reflectance at all wavelengths but especially in the visible of the lower (oldest) leaves. NDVI-like parameters were useful in distinguishing stress and control leaves over the growing season. However, several narrow-band indices provided better physiological information than NDVI. The physiological reflectance index (PRI) (_R_550 − _R_530 / _R_550 + _R_530) followed diurnal changes in xanthophyll pigments and photosynthetic rates of control and N-limited leaves. The maximum of the first derivative of reflectance in the green (_dG_) was correlated with diurnal photosynthetic rate, and with seasonal chl and N changes. The normalized pigment chlorophyll ratio Index (NPCI) (_R_680 − _R_430 / _R_680 + _R_430) varied with total pigments / chl. The water band index (WBI) (_R_970 / _R_902) followed water status. The normalized ratio between the maxima of the first derivatives of reflectances at the red edge and green regions (EGFN) was correlated with chl and N content. Principal components analysis yielded several indicators of physiological status. The first principal component was higher in control leaves, the second was higher in N-limited leaves, and the third was higher in water-limited leaves. Discriminant analysis based on the combination of several narrow-band spectral indices clearly separated leaves into the three treatment groups. These results illustrate the promise of narrow-band spectroradiometry for assessing the physiological state of vegetation.

## Abstract

The sensitivity of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to soil background and atmospheric effects has generated an increasing interest in the development of new indices, such as the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI), atmospherically resistant vegetation index (AR VI), global environment monitoring index (GEMI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), which are less sensitive to these external influences. These indices are theoretically more reliable than NDVI, although they are not yet widely used with satellite data. This article focuses on testing and comparing the sensitivity of NDVI, SAVI, TSAVI, MSAVI and GEMI to soil background effects. Indices are simulated with the SAIL model for a large range of soil reflectances, including sand, clay, and dark peat, with additional variations induced by moisture and roughness. The general formulation of the SAVI family of indices with the form VI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R + X) is also reexamined. The value of the parameter X is critical in the minimization of soil effects. A value of _X_ = 0.16 is found as the optimized value. Index performances are compared by means of an analysis of variance.

## Abstract

Spectral imaging data acquired with Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer over Point Dume (Los Angeles County, CA, USA) were used to assess the ability of hyperspectral reflectance data to estimate canopy Relative Water Content (RWC) at the landscape level. The study was performed on 23 vegetation stands comprised of three characteristic chaparral plant communities, with contrasting phenological stages and canopy cover. Several estimates of water content based on the near-infrared (NIR; reflectance indices and water thickness derived from reflectance and radiance data) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) water absorption bands were compared to measurements of vegetation structure and water content made on the ground. The Water Index (WI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), reflectance indices formulated from the NIR water absorption bands, were the best indicators of canopy RWC estimated from combining leaf relative water content with measures of canopy structure. A stepwise multiple regression revealed that canopy structure explained 36% and 41% of the variation in WI and NDWI, respectively. The explained variance in WI and NDWI increased to 44% and 48% when leaf relative water content was included in the model. By contrast, the inclusion of leaf relative water content did not contribute significantly to the explained variance in indices formulated using SWIR water absorption bands and in those based on water thickness. The relationship between WI and the canopy RWC significantly improved when only data from plots with green vegetation cover >70% were considered (_r_2=0.88, p<0.001). All the indices studied had an important structural component (as indicated by the strong correlation with NDVI), yet only the indices WI and NDWI additionally responded to water content. These results indicate that the WI and NDWI are sensitive to variations in canopy relative water content at the landscape scale.

## Introduction

Determination of vegetation water status from spectral reflectance has important applications in the fields of agriculture and forestry (Gao and Goetz, 1995). Water stress is one of the most common limitations to photosynthesis and plant primary productivity, and its measurement has importance for irrigation practices and in the drought assessment of natural communities (Peñuelas et al., 1993). Moreover, the water content of vegetation is a key factor in its susceptibility to fire Chandler et al. 1983, Pyne et al. 1996.

Besides the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum (8–14 _μ_m), two spectral regions have been found to be useful for the detection of plant water content: the near-infrared region (NIR, 700–1,300 nm) and the shortwave infrared region (SWIR, 1,300–2,500 nm). Both regions exhibit liquid water absorption features, and these are evident in the reflectance spectra of a fully turgid leaf measured in the laboratory Carter 1991, Danson et al. 1992. Several studies have shown relationships between leaf water content and spectral reflectance at the liquid water absorption wavelengths in the SWIR Hunt and Rock 1989, Bowman 1989, Danson et al. 1992 and the NIR region Peñuelas et al. 1993, Gao 1996, Peñuelas and Inoue 1999.

At the canopy level, several narrow-band indices have been developed to assess water content. Previous studies have shown linear relationships between leaf Relative Water Content (RWC) and the reflectance ratio R900/R970 (Water Index, WI) for complete canopies where Leaf Area Index (LAI) does not vary greatly (Peñuelas et al., 1996). Similar results were found by Shibayama et al. (1993) and Rollin and Milton (1998) using derivative analysis and ratio indices in the NIR region. Indices based on the SWIR region water absorption bands (Normalized Difference Infrared Index, NDII) have also provided good correlations with canopy water content (Hardisky et al., 1983). Other studies have found it difficult to estimate water content at the canopy level due to large reflectance variation among leaves at similar levels of water stress (Cohen, 1991) and associated with changes in canopy geometry resulting from turgor loss (Kimes et al., 1984), as well as due to the small reflectance differences at different levels of water stress (Riggs and Running, 1991).

At increasingly larger spatial scales, remote sensing of vegetation water content from liquid water absorption features is more challenging. A major difficulty when estimating canopy water content from remotely sensed data comes from the fact that LAI and background area (soil and nonphotosynthetic components) vary spatially, temporally, and with sensor view angle. Additionally, remote sensing of vegetation water content using airborne and satellite sensors is affected by water vapor in the atmosphere, which prevents the measurement of reflectance at the liquid water absorption bands around 1,450 nm and 1,920 nm (Rollin and Milton, 1998). Some signal remains in the NIR region, where there is a wavelength separation of about 30 nm between peak absorption of water in vapor and liquid forms. Over the last decade, the development of high resolution spectrometers has permitted the separation of the water vapor in the atmospheric column from the liquid water of the surface Green et al. 1989, Green et al. 1993, Gao and Goetz 1990, Roberts et al. 1997.

In airborne studies, several analytical techniques have been widely used to interpret water absorption features. Canopy water content has been derived from Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) surface reflectance data by inversion of radiative transfer models Jacquemoud et al. 1995, Jacquemoud et al. 1996 and using spectral matching techniques Gao and Goetz 1995, Zhang et al. 1996, Roberts et al. 1998. In the latter approach, the absorption spectrum of green vegetation in the liquid water bands is usually expressed as the thickness of a sheet of water (or Equivalent Water Thickness, EWT). Roberts et al. (1997) showed the potential of the retrieved EWT (a product that results from the atmospheric correction of AVIRIS-measured radiance to apparent surface reflectance) to monitor temporal and spatial variations in water in herbaceous, shrub, and coniferous vegetation. Pinzon et al. (1998) used the hierarchical foreground/background analysis, a cascade method regressing the full spectrum in the singular value decomposition space, and showed good predictions on leaves obtained from a wide range of vegetation types. Ustin et al. (1998b) showed that each of these methods could be used to estimate canopy water content of chaparral shrubs using the full AVIRIS reflectance spectrum. Moreover, significant seasonal differences in canopy water content could be detected in AVIRIS images Ustin et al. 1998a, Ustin et al. 1998b, Ustin et al. 1999. However, some satellite sensors (such as Advanced Spaceborne Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) do not have contiguous spectral coverage in the 0.4–2.5-_μ_m region, thus requiring the use of spectral feature mapping or ratio techniques (Gao, 1996). As a consequence, the use of narrow-band-based indices to assess water content at the landscape scale has gained interest. Based on AVIRIS imagery, Gao (1996) proposed monitoring of vegetation water content by combining reflectances at 860 nm (a reference wavelength) and 1,240 nm (a liquid water absorption band). The resulting Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was found to be sensitive to changes in vegetation water content. WI, also called the Water Band Index (WBI), has been reported to be a robust index of water content at the leaf and canopy levels (Peñuelas et al. 1993, Peñuelas et al. 1996, Peñuelas et al. 1997; Peñuelas et al., 1999). Similar results were obtained when deriving WI values from combined leaf and forest reflectance models Dawson et al. 1997, Dawson et al. 1999. Studies with AVIRIS and field spectrometers indicate that WI can differentiate changing water content associated with season and vegetation type in southern California scrub vegetation Gamon et al. 1998, Gamon and Qiu 1999. However, quantitative tests of this index against actual, field-measured water content are needed.

We tested the ability of the NIR-based indices WI and NDWI derived from AVIRIS apparent surface reflectance spectra to determine vegetation water content at the landscape level for three distinct plant communities , under varying vegetation cover. We compared the WI and NDWI with surface water estimates (EWT and water thickness) and other reflectance indices sensing water content derived from AVIRIS spectral data in the SWIR region. We also aimed to evaluate the relative contributions of vegetation structure and water content to the reflectance signal.

## Field Site and Vegetation Description

The study area was located in the Santa Monica Mountains (California, USA), a range trending east–west from the Los Angeles metropolitan area toward Ventura County, along the Pacific Coast (34°5′ N 118° 40′ W). This region is characterized by a Mediterranean climate, having cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Three distinct chaparral communities were considered in this study: ceanothus chaparral (dominated by _Ceanothus_ spp.), chamise chaparral (dominated by _Adenostoma fasciculatum_), and

## Plant Community Spectral Responses

The AVIRIS scene of the Point Dume area is depicted as a three-band pseudocolor image (1,659 nm, 838 nm, and 666 nm: RGB) in Fig. 1. Vegetated areas with high water content appear greener to the eye. Conversely, areas of sparse and senescent vegetation are seen as a brownish-red color, more abundant nearby the coast, but also conspicuous at Castro Crest. These patterns are due to the presence of coastal sage scrub, which grows mainly nearby the coast and experiences senescence following summer

## Conclusions

Although a number of leaf and canopy scale studies exist, few studies have compared ratio techniques and physical methods to direct water content at the landscape level. All the indices sensing water status, as well as NDVI, effectively discriminated among plant communities. Through statistical techniques (stepwise regressions and analyses of residuals) we identified the canopy structure as the main source of signal variation in the reflectance indices studied. However, WI and NDWI appeared to

## Abstract

This paper outlines the first part of a series of research studies to investigate the potential and approaches for using optical [remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to assess vegetation water content. It first analyzes why most methods used as approximations of vegetation water content (such as vegetation stress indices, estimation of degree of curing and chlorophyll content) are not suitable for retrieving water content at leaf level. It then documents the physical basis supporting the use of [remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to directly detect vegetation water content in terms of Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) at leaf level. Using laboratory measurements, the [radiative transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiative-transfer "Learn more about radiative transfer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") model PROSPECT and a sensitivity analysis, it shows that shortwave infrared (SWIR) is sensitive to EWT but cannot be used alone to retrieve EWT because two other leaf parameters (internal structure and dry matter) also influence leaf reflectance in the SWIR. A combination of SWIR and NIR (only influenced by these two parameters) is necessary to retrieve EWT at leaf level. These results set the basis towards establishing operational techniques for the retrieval of EWT at top-of-canopy and top-of-atmospheric levels.

## Introduction

During the last decades, the repeated occurrence of severe wildfires affecting various parts of the world has highlighted the need to develop effective monitoring tools to assess and eventually mitigate these phenomena. Research on biomass burning has progressed from monitoring active fires using satellite data Malingreau & Tucker, 1988, Flasse & Ceccato, 1996 to studying impacts of biomass burning on the environment (Levine, 1996). To understand biomass burning processes, it is essential to monitor the parameters that influence these processes, such as meteorological variables, amount of biomass, and vegetation water content. Remote sensing is advantageous for the detection of vegetation water content since it could provide an indication of fire occurrence risks and burning processes from a local to global scale.

The first step towards establishing an operational technique to retrieve vegetation water content using remote sensing is to clearly identify and demonstrate where the potential lies. This study investigates the first level at which water content influences a radiometric response, i.e. at leaf level. It initially discusses the suitability of existing remote sensing methods for assessing vegetation water content in the context of biomass burning and clarifies definitions that are commonly used. It then documents the physical basis supporting the use of remote sensing to directly detect vegetation water content in terms of Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT), and discusses a method for improving the accuracy in retrieving EWT at leaf level.

## Abstract

A simple and relatively accurate technique for classifying time-series [Landsat Thematic Mapper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/landsat-thematic-mapper "Learn more about Landsat Thematic Mapper from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (TM) imagery to detect levels of forest harvest is the topic of this research. The accuracy of multidate classification of the [normalized difference vegetation index](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/normalized-difference-vegetation-index "Learn more about normalized difference vegetation index from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) were compared and the effect of the number of years (1–3, 3–4, 5–6 years) between image acquisition on forest change accuracy was evaluated. When [Landsat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/landsat "Learn more about Landsat from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") image acquisitions were only 1–3 years apart, forest clearcuts were detected with producer's accuracy ranging from 79% to 96% using the RGB-NDMI classification method. Partial harvests were detected with lower producer's accuracy (55–80%) accuracy. The accuracy of both clearcut and partial harvests decreased as time between image acquisition increased. In all classification trials, the RGB-NDMI method produced significantly higher accuracies, compared to the RGB-NDVI. These results are interesting because the less common NDMI (using the reflected middle infrared band) outperformed the more popular NDVI. In northern Maine, industrial forest landowners have shifted from clearcutting to partial harvest systems in recent years. The RGB-NDMI change detection classification applied to [Landsat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/landsat "Learn more about Landsat from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") TM imagery collected every 2–3 years appears to be a promising technique for monitoring forest harvesting and other disturbances that do not remove the entire [overstory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/overstory "Learn more about overstory from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") canopy.

## Introduction

Forests encompass 89% of Maine's land area (Griffith & Alerich, 1996), which distinguishes Maine as the most forested state in the United States (Maine Forest Service, 1999). Of the 17.1 million hectares of forestland, approximately 95% is classified as commercial timberland Maine Forest Service, 1995, Maine Forest Service, 2000. Currently, most forest disturbance is a result of timber harvesting. Landowners in Maine use three harvesting systems: selection, shelterwood, and clearcut harvesting (Maine Forest Service, 1999). In the past, industrial forest landowners primarily used clearcut methods for timber harvesting. However, since the implementation of the Maine Forest Practices Act (MFPA) in 1991, clearcuts have been heavily regulated, and the use of partial harvest methods has increased. A partial harvest is defined as all harvest systems except clearcut harvest (Maine Forest Service, 1995). Partial harvests are more difficult to detect on satellite imagery than clearcuts, although previous studies have reported good relationships using Landsat TM imagery Franklin et al., 2000, Hame, 1991, Olsson, 1994.

Satellite images covering large areas of land have potential to monitor forest change in Maine and contribute to forest inventory and management goals in a cost effective manner. Bertrand, Sader, and Hayes (2000) used Landsat change detection over an 11-year (1988–1999) time period to explore the effect of the MFPA on clearcut and partial cut harvesting patterns in 29 towns in northwestern Maine. Change maps had overall accuracies between 90.0% and 94.0% and distinguished between clearcut and partial cuts over four time periods. During the 11 years, they found the number of clearcuts as well as the mean size decreased. The percentage of area that experienced partial cutting remained constant, with a decrease in the number of partial cuts and an increase in size (Bertrand et al., 2000).

Partial harvests on satellite imagery look distinctly different from the relatively homogeneous appearance of undisturbed forest or clearcut harvests. Partial harvests appear textured with distinct boundaries and adjacent road features. The textured appearance is likely due to the heterogeneous canopy with tall trees and canopy gaps causing mixed pixels with varying digital numbers. When attempting to distinguish western US old growth forest stands from mature forests, Fiorella and Ripple (1993) state that the two most distinguishing features observed at the forest canopy level were differences in the number and size of gaps and heterogeneity of tree sizes. They found good correlation between several Thematic Mapper (TM) bands and forest structure.

New methods that utilize time series satellite imagery to detect levels of harvest disturbance in forest stands are the topic of this research. The objective is to compare the success of different satellite remote sensing techniques to detect forest harvest intensity over time in a northern Maine industrial forest setting. The first study compares two vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), for detecting forest change. The second study compares the accuracy of forest change detection maps when images are 1–3, 3–4, and 5–6 years apart.

Successful results from previous research guided the selection of the change detection method evaluated in this study. Muchoney and Haack (1994) compared four change detection techniques to identify changes in hardwood forest defoliation caused by gypsy moth. The four change detection techniques were merged principal components analysis, image differencing, spectral–temporal (layered temporal) change classification, and postclassification change differencing (delta classification). These authors reported that detection of forest change due to gypsy moth defoliation was most accurate using the image differencing and principal components analysis methods. Coppin and Bauer (1996) reviewed more than 75 change detection studies and concluded that image differencing and linear transformations appeared to perform better than other change detection methods.

Hayes and Sader (2001) compared image differencing, principal component analysis, and RGB-NDVI methods for a tropical forest study site. They found the RGB-NDVI change detection method to be the most accurate and efficient to analyze several dates of Landsat TM imagery. When determining change, RGB-NDVI incorporated three dates at one time as opposed to two-date sequences used with other methods such as image differencing, delta classification, and multitemporal linear data transformations. The RGB-NDVI unsupervised classification avoided subjective decisions in setting histogram thresholds (which would have been necessary for several two-date image differencing sequences) and was more straightforward and time efficient. Finally, the analysis of cluster statistics (e.g., mean NDVI value over time) and visual interpretation of RGB-NDVI composites aided by additive color theory logic (Sader & Winne, 1992), facilitated identification of classified clusters representing forest clearing classes, a no change class, and regrowth classes in a time-series (Hayes & Sader, 2001). For these reasons, the RGB-NDVI classification (Sader, Hayes, Coan, Hepinstall, & Soza, 2001) was selected as the change detection method suitable for analyzing multiple dates (seven) of satellite imagery in this study.

When classifying an agricultural region of Egypt, Pax-Lenney and Woodcock (1997) reported that the number and timing of images are of primary importance, and that the optimum number of images needed can be difficult to determine. Coppin and Bauer (1996) found, after reviewing the literature, that the availability of satellite data often determined the intervals between data acquisition. Pax-Lenney amd Woodcock listed two factors that contributed to the difficulty of conducting temporal resolution studies. First, the compilation of comprehensive data sets is limited by weather conditions, cost, computing resources, and sensor capabilities. Second, landscapes are dynamic and the ideal number and timing of image acquisition for monitoring varies with location, time, and measure of interest. Therefore, although research addressing the question of temporal resolution is location and application specific, and whether multitemporal images are used for change detection or classification, the amount of time between satellite acquisition needs to be determined. Without compromising accuracy, fewer images would result in savings in terms of imagery costs as well as time for processing (Pax-Lenney & Woodcock, 1997). In a tropical forest study site, Kimes, Nelson, Skole, and Salas (1998) reviewed the potential error from “temporal gaps” involved in sequential satellite image analyses, as well as ways to measure it.

The NDVI separates green vegetation from other surfaces because the chlorophyll of green vegetation absorbs red light for photosynthesis and reflects the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths due to scattering caused by internal leaf structure (Tucker, 1979). Thus, high NDVI values indicate high leaf biomass, canopy closure, or leaf area Jasinski, 1990, Sader & Winne, 1992, Sellers, 1985. The ease of calculating NDVI from various types of satellite data, the success of the NDVI in detecting vegetation, and its ease in calculation and interpretation has made it a popular spectral vegetation index Cohen, 1994, Gao, 1996, Myneni & Asrar, 1994, as well as a widely used data product for studying vegetation with remotely sensed images (Chavez & MacKinnon, 1994). The NDVI is calculated using the formula in Eq. (1).

The method of change detection used in this study, RGB-NDVI, incorporates multiple NDVIs for detecting and quantifying major decreases or increases in green biomass associated with forest harvest or regeneration Hayes & Sader, 2001, Sader et al., 2001.

NDMI is the second index and is calculated by Eq. (2) where the NIR is Landsat TM Band 4 and the mid-infrared (MIR) is Landsat TM Band 5.

This index is referred to as the NDMI, however, the term _moisture_ is conventional and retained for lack of a better term. One reason a universally accepted term is lacking is because the biophysical interpretation of indices that use the MIR bands is more problematic than indices that use only red and NIR bands. Other factors such as emissivity, energy balance, forest structure, and forest cover must be considered (McDonald, Gemmell, & Lewis, 1998).

The difference between the NIR and the MIR appears to be the ability of the MIR wavelengths to absorb water. From a green leaf, the NIR band has the maximum reflectance of the six shortwave TM bands, and the reduction of reflectance of the MIR as compared to the NIR is due to the absorption of water Cibula et al., 1992, Hunt et al., 1987. Hunt et al. found that reflectance of TM5 for dry leaves was almost exactly equal to reflectance of TM4, so that the difference between TM4 and TM5 for a fresh leaf should equal the water absorbance in that leaf. The NDMI is formulated using a contrast between the NIR band and MIR band. The tasseled cap transformation of Landsat TM has a “wetness” feature that contrasts the visible and NIR bands (TM1–4) with the MIR bands (TM5 and 7) (Crist & Cicone, 1984). Because this feature is theoretically similar to the NDMI, it is discussed in some detail.

The “tasseled cap” transformation is a method of rotating satellite data such that the majority of the information is contained in components or features that relate directly to physical scene characteristics Kauth & Thomas, 1976, Lillesand & Kiefer, 1994. The first and second features of TM are brightness and greenness, respectively. The third feature is termed “wetness” because it is sensitive to soil and plant moisture (Crist & Cicone, 1984). Cohen (1994) reported that the “scant literature on the subject” revealed that the wetness feature responds to both water and shadows in a ground scene. Other researchers have found the “wetness” feature to be sensitive to shadowing, leaf water content, and possibly other effects not yet discovered (Horler & Ahern, 1986) or to reflect a combination of structure and water content (Cohen, Spies, & Fiorella, 1995).

Although there is debate surrounding a suitable term for “wetness,” it is nevertheless useful for forest applications. Fiorella and Ripple (1993) attempted to separate old growth and mature forests in the Pacific Northwest using Landsat TM imagery. They found that the tasseled cap features of brightness and greenness did not separate old growth and mature forests. However, wetness was highly significant and better than all other single TM bands and most band ratios. Landsat TM4/5 ratio and tasseled cap wetness had similar significance levels and were highly correlated. They suggest using the TM4/5 ratio rather than tasseled cap wetness because the former is simpler to calculate and interpret. Collins and Woodcock (1996) utilized the multitemporal Kauth-Thomas method of change detection and found change in wetness is a good indicator of conifer mortality, and the most consistent single indicator of forest change due to its capture of MIR changes. Franklin et al. (2000) found the wetness component to be an important feature in detecting changes due to partial harvesting in eastern Canada. Because wetness is a good indicator of forest change, the NDMI is thought to be also.

Seven dates (1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, and 1999) (Fig. 1) of satellite imagery were acquired in the summer months representing hardwood “leaf on” conditions. All satellite data were recorded by the Landsat TM sensor except the 1997 image, which was recorded by the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1C). The Landsat scene locations were based on the Landsat worldwide reference system, and were either Path 12 Row 28 or Path 11 Row 28. The IRS scene was recorded on Path 293 Row 37.

The area of overlap of all seven dates of imagery determined the final study site (Fig. 1). It was necessary to select an area covered by all seven images to allow the testing and evaluation of methods including the effect of time interval between image acquisition dates on change detection accuracy. The study site is approximately 499,176 ha and includes part or all of 84 townships in northern Maine, USA. Its approximate latitude and longitude are N45°44′00″, N46°35′00″, W69°35′00″, and W68°30′00″. The area is almost entirely industrial forestland with extensive forest harvest activity and minimal urban development.

## Preprocessing

After data acquisition, all scenes were georeferenced to the previously rectified 1991 Landsat TM scene corresponding to the Clark 1866 spheroid, NAD27 datum, and UTM projection at 30-m pixel resolution with less than half a pixel error (Hepinstall, Sader, Krohn, Boone, & Bartlett, 1999). Each of the other scenes was georeferenced to the 1991 image using well-distributed ground control points. All images were referenced so that the root mean square error was below half a pixel or 15 m. Image

## Change detection maps

_Z_ statistics revealed that all change maps were significantly different from random and significantly different from each other.

## Conclusions

When image acquisitions were only 1–3 years apart, clearcuts were detected with better accuracy using either NDMI or NDVI; however, partial harvests were detected with lower accuracy (especially using NDVI) as time interval between image acquisition dates increased. The NDVI technique for monitoring vegetation greenness and biomass is a well known and commonly used method in forest change detection, yet this study confirmed that the less common NDMI method (utilizing the middle infrared band

## Abstract

Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of [spectral reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/spectral-reflectance "Learn more about spectral reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") provides a fast, [nondestructive method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nondestructive-methods "Learn more about nondestructive method from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between [pigments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/photosynthetic-pigment "Learn more about pigments from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and [plant functional types](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/plant-functional-type "Learn more about plant functional types from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Leaf [surface reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/surface-reflectance "Learn more about surface reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published [carotenoid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/carotenoid "Learn more about carotenoid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and [anthocyanin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/anthocyanin "Learn more about anthocyanin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of [xanthophyll](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/xanthophyll "Learn more about xanthophyll from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments.

## Introduction

Pigments are integrally related to the physiological function of leaves. Chlorophylls absorb light energy and transfer it into the photosynthetic apparatus. Carotenoids (yellow pigments) can also contribute energy to the photosynthetic system. However, when incident light energy exceeds that needed for photosynthesis, the carotenoids that compose the xanthophyll cycle dissipate excess energy, thus avoiding damage to the photosynthetic system (Demmig-Adams & Adams, 1996). Anthocyanins (pink, purple, and red pigments) may also protect leaves from excess light Barker et al., 1997, Dodd et al., 1998, Gould et al., 1995 or from UV light Burger & Edwards, 1996, Klaper et al., 1996, Mendez et al., 1999. However, a study of the location of anthocyanins in leaves of a wide range of species found that anthocyanins were more common in the mesophyll and lower epidermis than in the upper epidermis where they would be most effective as light screens (Gould & Quinn, 1999). Anthocyanins may also serve as scavengers of reactive oxygen intermediates Sherwin & Farrant, 1998, Yamasaki, 1997 or as antifungal compounds (Coley & Kusar, 1996).

Because of the importance of pigments for leaf function, variations in pigment content may provide information concerning the physiological state of leaves. Chlorophyll tends to decline more rapidly than carotenoids when plants are under stress or during leaf senescence Gitelson & Merzlyak, 1994a, Gitelson & Merzlyak, 1994b, Merzlyak et al., 1999. Anthocyanin content tends to be high in young leaves that also have low photosynthetic rates (Gamon & Surfus, 1999), in leaves of plants where growth has been limited by low temperature or other stresses Chalker-Scott, 1999, Cobbina & Miller, 1987, Pietrini & Massacci, 1998, and in senescing leaves of certain species.

Traditional methods of pigment analysis, through extraction and spectrophotometric or HPLC measurement, require destruction of the measured leaves and thus do not permit measurement of changes in pigments over time for a single leaf. In addition, the techniques are time consuming and expensive, thus making assessment of the overall vegetation health of landscapes and ecosystems impractical. In contrast, measurement of spectral reflectance is nondestructive, rapid, and can be applied across spatial scales (Gamon & Qiu, 1999). Some good theoretical models have been developed for prediction of leaf reflectance from pigment, water content, and structure variables Dawson et al., 1998, Jacquemoud et al., 1996. However, these theoretical models are difficult to invert and require information about leaf structure that may not be available. Consequently, most relationships between leaf reflectance and pigment contents have been derived empirically.

To be most useful in ecological studies, these relationships should be generalizable across species and leaf developmental stages. However, most of the relationships between leaf reflectance and pigment content have been developed and tested for only one or at most a few closely related species (e.g., Blackburn, 1998a, Blackburn, 1998b, Chappelle et al., 1992, Gamon & Surfus, 1999, Gitelson & Merzlyak, 1994a). Structural differences (i.e., leaf thickness, density, number of air water interfaces, cuticle thickness, and pubescence) between leaves may have significant effects on these relationships. Light reflected directly from the leaf surface never enters the leaf cells and thus is not influenced by pigment and water content. Surface reflection can be greatly enhanced by leaf hairs Billings & Morris, 1951, Ehleringer et al., 1976 or surface waxes Cameron, 1970, Clark & Lister, 1975, Reicosky & Hanover, 1978. Hairs increase reflectance throughout the visible region of the spectrum but their effect in the near infrared is variable Grant, 1987, Slaton et al., 2001. Waxes increase surface reflectance throughout the visible and NIR regions of the spectrum although the effect is often greatest at shorter wavelengths due to Rayleigh scattering Clark & Lister, 1975, Reicosky & Hanover, 1978. Light that does enter the leaf follows a complex and unpredictable path due to internal reflection and scattering. Fukshansky et al. (1993) calculated the mean path length of light through a leaf to be two to four times the leaf thickness. This results in the observed broadening of pigment absorption peaks in vivo as compared to in vitro measurements (Fukshansky et al., 1993). Finally, pigments are not distributed homogeneously in leaf tissue so that even light that travels through an equal path length may encounter different amounts of pigment Fukshansky et al., 1993, Rabinowitch, 1951.

Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation. We collected young, mature, and senescent leaves from a wide range of species and functional types that varied greatly in structural characteristics and quantified the effects of these structural variations on the relationship between pigment content and spectral indices. We tested several published spectral indices using this data set, and developed a new set of indices that were less sensitive to leaf structural variation.

We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when three pigment classes, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins occur within the same leaf tissue. Mature and senescent leaves of sweetgum (_Liquidambar styraciflua_) proved ideal for this purpose since it was possible to find almost all possible combinations of these three pigment classes in leaves of this species.

## Chlorophyll

The chlorophylls have strong absorbance peaks in the red and blue regions of the spectrum (Fig. 1a). Since the blue peak overlaps with the absorbance of the carotenoids, it is not generally used for estimation of chlorophyll content. Maximal absorbance in the red region occurs between 660 and 680 nm. However, reflectance at these wavelengths has not proved as useful for prediction of chlorophyll content as has reflectance at slightly longer or shorter wavelengths. This is because relatively low 

## Plant material

A total of nearly 400 leaf samples were collected and analyzed. These leaves were selected to represent as large a range of plant functional types, leaf structures and leaf developmental stages as possible and included 53 species (Table 2). To compare the variability within a species (i.e., minimal structural variation) to that between species, 123 leaves spanning a wide range of pigment contents and leaf developmental stages were collected from a single species, _L. styraciflua_. The leaves were 

## Chlorophyll

Both Lichtenthaler's (1987) chlorophyll equations and our equations modified to include the effect of anthocyanins produced results that correlated closely with HPLC chlorophyll determinations (_r_2>.96, Fig. 2). However, the anthocyanin correction did slightly improve the accuracy of the estimations. This effect was only a few percent at high chlorophyll contents but increased to as high as 20% for leaves with very low chlorophyll and high anthocyanin contents.

We used the data for _L. styraciflua_ 

## Leaf structure effects

When applied across a wide range of species, leaf structures, and plant functional types, previously published spectral indices provided poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content. Our analysis suggests that leaf surface reflectance was the most important factor in this variation. Our modified indices, mSR705 and mND705, which were designed to eliminate the effect of leaf surface reflectance, were substantially better correlated (_r_2 as high as .83) with chlorophyll content across all the

## Abstract

[Remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about Remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") estimates of vegetation nitrogen (N) and lignin concentration are central to assess ecosystem processes such as growth and decomposition. Although remote sensing techniques have been proven useful to assess N and lignin contents in continuous green canopies, more studies are needed to address their capabilities, particularly in low and sparsely vegetated ecosystems. We investigated the possibility of estimating canopy N and lignin concentrations in chaparral vegetation using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance acquired over an area around Point Dume in the Santa Monica Mountains (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Two approaches were tested: multiple stepwise regression based on first difference reflectance (FDR) and reflectance (_R_) indices. Multiple stepwise regressions (of three or fewer wavelengths) accounted for a large variance in canopy biochemical concentration (_r_2∼0.9, _P_<0.01). Log transformed _R_ indices [log (1/_R_)] formulated on the basis of previously known N and lignin absorption wavelengths also showed significant correlations (_P_<0.01) with canopy biochemical concentration (_r_2 ranging from 0.39 to 0.48). In addition, the contribution of structural and biochemical signals and background effects on the performance of these indices was evaluated. These indices accounted for a increased variance when adding information on canopy structural attributes (e.g., relative contribution of each species and biomass amount) to foliar biochemical concentration. The relative contributions of foliar biochemical concentration and canopy structure (biomass amount) on the spectral signal were further evaluated by analyzing the residuals from linear regressions: foliar N concentration accounted for 42% of the variance for a normalized difference index based on the 1510-nm N absorption feature, while the foliar lignin concentration accounted for 44% of the variance for a normalized difference index based on the 1754 nm lignin absorption feature. These percentages increased to 58% when stands with senescing vegetation were disregarded. We propose the two indices, Normalized Difference Nitrogen Index (NDNI=[log (1/_R_1510)−log (1/_R_1680)]/[log (1/_R_1510)+log (1/_R_1680)]) and Normalized Difference Lignin Index (NDLI=[log (1/_R_1754)−log (1/_R_1680)]/[log (1/_R_1754)+log (1/_R_1680)]) as indices to assess N and lignin in native shrub vegetation.

## Introduction

Several important ecosystem processes have been linked to plant biochemical composition, specifically to nitrogen (N) and lignin concentrations (Aber & Federer, 1992). N concentration in foliage is related to maximum photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic capacity (Field & Mooney, 1986) as well as to aboveground net primary production (Birk & Vitousek, 1986). Foliar lignin concentration is related to litter decomposition rates (Melillo, Aber, & Muratore, 1982). Thus, plant biochemical composition is related to factors controlling growth and decomposition and it provides information on plant and ecosystem processes such as carbon (C) and N cycling (Aber & Federer, 1992).

Remote sensing is a key tool for assessing vegetation condition over large areas, offering the possibility to analyzing ecological issues at a wide range of spatial scales Hope, 1995, Ustin et al., 1991. Furthermore, remotely sensed data can be used as inputs in ecosystem models that are used to assess functional changes brought by climate variability and land use change (Scholes & Archer, 1997).

Estimation of plant biochemical composition through high spectral resolution remote sensing has its foundation in laboratory near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) Martin, 1992, Williams & Norris, 1987. At the leaf level, NIRS has been successfully used to predict N, cellulose, and lignin concentrations on ground dried foliage (Joffre, Gillon, Dardenne, Agneessens, & Biston, 1992). Several studies have also demonstrated the utility of hyperspectral data to estimate canopy N and lignin content at increasing spatial scales. Improvements in intrinsic characteristics of spectrometers such the signal-to-noise ratio, as well as in methods to correct for undesirable atmospheric effects have led to the accuracy necessary for the estimation of the biochemical concentration of forest canopies (Curran, Kupiek, & Smith, 1997). Wessman, Aber, and Peterson (1989) reported large correlations between forest canopy biochemical composition and first-difference-at-sensor radiance measured by the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS). Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) spectra have been used to estimate lignin and N concentrations in mixed-species forest canopies Johnson et al., 1994, Martin, 1994, Martin & Aber, 1997, Matson et al., 1994 and single-species canopies (Curran et al., 1997) using first difference reflectance (FDR) data and stepwise regression techniques. Although hyperspectral imagery has been used to detect changes in canopy biochemical concentration at the pixel level in dense vegetation (crops and forests), it has proven difficult on arid and semiarid ecosystems characterized by sparse vegetation and low soil cover Asner et al., 2000, Asner et al., 1998. Moreover, equations formulated using multiple stepwise regression techniques have been reported to give inconsistent results when applied across different vegetation types and to yield inaccurate estimates when applied to data sets other than those where the relationships were developed Grossman et al., 1996, Martin & Aber, 1997. In addition, the selected wavelengths in stepwise regression are not always related to the biochemical of interest, but to wavelengths that relate to biomass amount (Johnson et al., 1994), or to wavelengths associated to absorption by other biochemicals (Curran, Dungan, & Peterson, 2001).

To overcome these drawbacks, several analytical techniques have been developed. Based on band depth analysis of continuum-removed reflectance spectra coupled with stepwise regression, Kokaly and Clark (1999) obtained good predictions of N, lignin, and cellulose contents on dried and ground leaves. Curran et al. (2001) using the latter methodology estimated the concentration of 12 foliar biochemicals with high accuracy. This methodology is not directly applicable to fresh whole leaves and canopies due to the presence of water (Kokaly & Clark, 1999), and, thus, has not yet been tested using field and airborne spectra. However, other techniques such as spectral matching techniques (Gao & Goetz, 1995) and radiative transfer models (Dawson, Curran, North, & Plummer, 1999) have been successfully applied to predict water and lignin concentration from AVIRIS data in forest canopies. We aimed to test the feasibility of reflectance indices to estimate N and lignin contents at the landscape level. Band ratioing and normalization provide a simple and straightforward means to enhance the biochemical absorption signal in vegetation while minimizing background effects (Jackson & Huete, 1991).

We were interested in studying to what extent foliar and canopy biochemical concentration could be estimated using hyperspectral reflectance data in Mediterranean ecosystems characterized by a relatively high soil cover combined with a low Leaf Area Index (LAI). We aimed (1) to compare the reliability of indices formulated with wavelengths related to known N and lignin absorption features and stepwise procedures to assess canopy N and lignin concentration and (2) to study the relative contributions of foliar biochemical concentration and canopy structure (standing biomass) on the proposed indices. Since, in contrast with previous AVIRIS studies, our study focuses on a complex mosaic of vegetation communities, species composition, as well as distinct functional types and vegetation structure, we finally aimed (3) to assess the dependence of reflectance-based biochemical estimates on confounding factors, such as exposed soil and nonphotosynthetic vegetation, across sites with different vegetation types in Mediterranean ecosystems.

## Field site and vegetation description

The study area was located in the Santa Monica Mountains (Los Angeles County, CA, USA), an east–west trending range along the Pacific Coast (34°5′N–118°40′W). This region is characterized by a Mediterranean climate. In this study, three distinct chaparral communities were considered: ceanothus chaparral (dominated by _Ceanothus_ spp.), chamise chaparral (dominated by _Adenostoma fasciculatum_), and coastal sage scrub (dominated by _Salvia_ and _Eriogonum_ spp. and _Artemisia californica_) (Hanes, 1988).

## Foliar N and lignin concentration

Foliar N concentration widely varied among species, according to the contrasting phenological stages and functional types. N concentrations ranged from 0.85 %plusmn; 0.02% SEM (Standard Error of the Mean, SEM) in _Adenostoma fasciculatum_ to 2.16±0.15% in _Ar. californica_. These were the lowest and highest values determined. By species and on average, the lowest and highest N concentrations were found in _Arctostaphyllos glandulosa_ (0.94±0.04% SEM) and _Artemia californica_ (1.98±0.07% SEM),

## Conclusions

The spectral indices NDNI and NDLI were affected by canopy closure (soil exposed) and were unable to assess foliar or bulk canopy N and lignin in senescing vegetation. In contrast, in green continuous canopies, NDNI and NDLI provided good estimates of the bulk canopy N and lignin. The relative contribution of the biochemical signal to the reflectance signal was significant, up to 58% of the residual variance, after taking into account the structure of the green vegetation. NDNI and NDLI showed

## Abstract

Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of optical indices from hyperspectral [remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the assessment of vegetation biophysical variables both in [forestry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/forestry "Learn more about forestry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and [agriculture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/agricultural-science "Learn more about agriculture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of [photosynthesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/photosystem "Learn more about photosynthesis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from [remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and [canopy reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/canopy-reflectance "Learn more about canopy reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH [radiative transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiative-transfer "Learn more about radiative transfer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted [Vegetation Index](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/vegetation-index "Learn more about Vegetation Index from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar [zenith angle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/zenith-angle "Learn more about zenith angle from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over [corn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/maize "Learn more about corn from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L'Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of _r_2=.81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data.

## Introduction

Remote sensing data and techniques have already proven to be relevant to many requirements of crop inventory and monitoring. Different studies and experiments demonstrated their usefulness and feasibility to address various agricultural issues, such as crop classification and mapping Erol & Akdeniz, 1996, Grignetti et al., 1997, Pax-Lenney & Woodcock, 1997, crop forecasting and yield predictions Clevers, 1997, Moran et al., 1995, Rasmussen, 1992, Tucker et al., 1980, crop status and condition Blackmer et al., 1994, Boissard et al., 1993, Clevers et al., 1994, Potdar, 1993, and crop disease and micronutrient deficiency Adams et al., 2000a, Adams et al., 2000b, Adams et al., 1999, Malthus & Madeira, 1993. Nowadays, there is an increased interest in precision farming and the development of smart systems for agricultural resources management; these relatively new approaches aim to increase the productivity, optimize the profitability, and protect the environment. In this context, image-based remote sensing technology is seen as a key tool to provide valuable information that is still lacking or inappropriate to the achievement of sustainable and efficient agricultural practices Daughtry et al., 2000, Moran et al., 1997. More specifically, farmers and agricultural managers are interested in measuring and assessing soil and crop status at specific critical times: first, in earlier growth stages in order to supply adequate fertilizers quantities for a normal growth of the crop, and second, during an advanced development stage for health monitoring and the prediction of yield. For this purpose, remote sensors can play a valuable role in providing time-specific and time-critical information for precision farming, due to their capabilities in measuring biophysical indicators/parameters and detecting their spatial variability. The latter is critical to the variable rate technology, which consists of applying specific inputs, such as fertilizers, for specific soil and crop conditions (Moran et al., 1997). Among the fertilizing elements, nitrogen is generally the most important and also the major limiting factor for crop growth and agriculture productivity.

Nitrogen concentration in green vegetation is related to chlorophyll content, and therefore indirectly to one of the basic plant physiological processes: photosynthesis. When nitrogen supply surpasses vegetation's nutritional needs, the excess is eliminated by runoff and water infiltration leading to pollution of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., eutrophication) (Wood, Reeves, & Himelrick, 1993, cited in Daughtry et al., 2000). This nitrogen loss to the environment represents an economic loss for farmers. However, inappropriate reduction of nitrogen supply could result in reduced yields, and subsequently, substantial economic losses. With this dilemma, the optimal and rational solution is an adequate assessment of nitrogen status and its variability in agricultural landscapes. Since yield is determined by crop condition at the earlier stages of growth, it is mandatory to provide farmers with nitrogen status at those stages in order to supply appropriate rates based upon an accurate assessment of plant growth requirements and deficiencies.

For this purpose, remote sensing techniques have been used to assess crop conditions relative to nitrogen status and effects. Foliage spectral properties, reflectance and transmittance, were found to be affected by nitrogen deficiency (Blackmer, Schepers, Varvel, & Walter-Shea, 1996): nitrogen shortage reduces leaf chlorophyll content, and therefore, increases its transmittance at visible wavelengths. Thus, reflected radiation from crop leaves and canopies has been used both to estimate chlorophyll concentration of crop canopies (Daughtry et al., 2000) and by implication to assess nitrogen variability and stress Blackmer et al., 1994, Blackmer et al., 1996. However, at the canopy scale, nitrogen treatments do not affect leaf chlorophyll content alone; they also induce differences in other biophysical parameters such as: Leaf Area Index (LAI), biomass, and foliage (Walburg, Bauer, Daughtry, & Housley, 1982). Moreover, optical indices developed for chlorophyll content estimation, using crop canopy reflected radiation, are responsive to other vegetation and environmental parameters like LAI and underlying soil reflectance Daughtry et al., 2000, Kim et al., 1994.

It is this multifactor interaction complexity, responsible for canopy spectral reflectance variability at different phenological stages, that inspired this work on developing a methodology for an accurate estimation of crop chlorophyll content. The objectives were: (i) to simulate corn canopy reflectance, using PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models, for various crop optical and biophysical variables; (ii) to elaborate a methodology for estimating crop chlorophyll concentration, using CASI hyperspectral airborne reflectance data; and (iii) to validate the estimates through a comparison with chlorophyll measurements in the laboratory from plot field sampling.

## Study area

The study area is one of the four experimental sites of the GEOmatics for Informed Decisions (GEOIDE) project for precision agriculture. It is located near Montreal, at the Horticultural Research and Development Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada, also known as the L'Acadie experimental research substation, where corn was grown on four adjacent experimental fields. In general, the soils in the fields were clay loam, with 31% sand, 33% silt, and 36% 

## Sensitivity to chlorophyll content

In a preliminary analysis for individual leaf spectra, chlorophyll indices MCARI (Eq. (1)) and TCARI (Eq. (2)) were plotted as a function of chlorophyll content for leaf reflectances derived by simulations with the PROSPECT model (Fig. 1). As chlorophyll content increases, MCARI initially increases, but then decreases as chlorophyll content exceeds 20 μg/cm2. This functional behavior denotes a sensitivity limitation of MCARI at low pigment concentrations, owing probably to its responsivity to

## Conclusion

In this study, leaf and canopy models (PROSPECT and SAILH) were employed to simulate chlorophyll and LAI effects on crop canopy reflectance. Then, a methodology for predicting chlorophyll status from hyperspectral data, based on combining vegetation and chlorophyll indices through scaling up, has been developed and successfully tested with airborne CASI hyperspectral images over a corn crop experimental site.

The methodology was used to investigate and take into account the effects of


# Designing a spectral index to estimate vegetation water content from remote sensing data: Part 1: Theoretical approach
## Abstract

This paper describes the methodology used to create a spectral index to retrieve vegetation water content from remotely sensed data in the [solar spectrum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/solar-spectra "Learn more about solar spectrum from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") domain. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using [radiative transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiative-transfer "Learn more about radiative transfer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") models is used to understand and quantify vegetation water content effects on the signal measured at three levels: leaf, canopy, and atmosphere. An index is then created that optimises retrieval of vegetation water content (in terms of water quantity per unit area at canopy level) and minimises perturbing effects of geophysical and atmospheric effects. The new index, optimised for the new SPOT-VEGETATION sensor, is presented as an example. Limitations and robustness of the index are also discussed.

## Introduction

Estimation of vegetation water content is central to the understanding of biomass burning processes. Recently, an international fire team, part of the project for Global Observation of Forest Cover, has recognised the necessity to improve satellite technologies and methods to generate accurate, global wildland fire fuel maps (Dull & Singh, 2000). One important factor of the maps is the fuel moisture used to assess the risks of fire occurrence and burning efficiency. Research on assessing vegetation moisture content has already been carried out using sensors working in the solar spectrum, thermal, and radar domains. However, the methods developed and tested over small regions do not allow the retrieval of vegetation water content, operationally, over different ecosystems, from local to global scale (see Ceccato, Flasse, Tarantola, Jacquemoud, & Grégoire, 2001, for a more detailed discussion).

Various methods can be used to extract specific information via remote sensing. One method is to invert models describing the physical processes that determine the measurements (Verstraete & Pinty, 1996). By constraining the inversion process, the joint use of measured and modelled angular fields of the scattered light reflected by the different components of the Earth yields more accurate and reliable retrievals (Diner et al., 1999). The arrival of the new Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) provides measurements from cameras pointing in nine different directions. These angular field measurements will therefore increase the precision of retrievals. However, for the time being, simpler methods using satellites looking straight down are still required to access the desired information. These methods are based on the development of indices and allow the rapid processing of large amounts of remote sensing data.

Spectral indices have been and are still widely used to retrieve information on vegetation biophysical properties. However, the creation and use of spectral indices are often performed with empirical methods. Any significant improvement of the indices, for instance, through corrections using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), enhances their utility and accuracy (Asner, Braswell, Schimel, & Wessman, 1998). In the solar spectrum domain, several attempts to estimate vegetation water content on the basis of satellite remote sensing data have relied on empirical relationships between vegetation moisture content and values of particular spectral indices (mostly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) computed from spectral reflectance Ceccato et al., 2001, Tucker, 1980.

At leaf level, research using laboratory measurements and model simulations has shown that the use of reflectance measured in the optical domain can provide an estimation of leaf water content in terms of equivalent water thickness (EWT) expressed in quantity of water per unit area (g cm−2) and not in terms of moisture content expressed in quantity of water per quantity of fresh or dry matter (%) (Ceccato et al., 2001). In addition, the authors showed that both the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and the near infrared (NIR) wavelength ranges are necessary for retrieving EWT at leaf level.

At canopy level, several authors proposed relationships between vegetation water content and spectral indices Downing et al., 1993, Hunt & Rock, 1989. Using the hyperspectral radiometer Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), Roberts, Green, and Adams (1997) and Ustin et al. (1998) studied the possibility to retrieve canopy vegetation water content. In addition, Dawson, Curran, North, and Plummer (1999) showed that the water index (WI) proposed by Peñuelas, Filella, Biel, Serrano, and Savé (1993) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) proposed by Gao (1996) were related to the quantity of water per unit area in the canopy. The authors determined the canopy water content by scaling the foliar water content (FWC, %) with the specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area index (LAI), and the percent canopy cover for a specific forest canopy. However, their method requires knowledge on SLA, which varies according to species and phenological status. When creating the NDWI, Gao suggested that the research be further developed, in particular using radiative transfer modelling, in order to understand this index well enough to use it with the new generation of satellite instruments such as MODIS and SPOT-VEGETATION. With the arrival of these new sensors carrying channels in the SWIR and NIR wavelength ranges, it becomes interesting, from a theoretical and practical point of view, to determine the limits of feasibility to retrieve reliably and accurately vegetation water content from remotely sensed observations.

The purpose of this paper is to expand the understanding of how variations in vegetation water content affect the signal measured at the satellite level and to create an index that is optimised for retrieving vegetation water content. The index aims to provide an operational method for quantitatively retrieving vegetation water content from local to global scale in a rapid and reliable fashion.

In Section 2, a study is performed using a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to identify the requirements prior to the development of the index. The GSA identifies the importance of vegetation water content variation, as well as other factors, on reflectance measured at the satellite level. It also identifies which wavelength regions can provide a solution to retrieve vegetation water content. In Section 3, this information is used to create an index that maximises the accuracy of water content retrieval while minimising the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption, as well as temporal and spatial variations in the geometry of illumination and observation. The characteristics of the new sensor SPOT-VEGETATION (Mayaux, Gond, & Bartholomé, 2000) are chosen to show how the method can be applied. Other sensors having wavelength bands similar to those described in the requirements could also potentially be used.

## Identifying the requirements

Before developing the index, it is important to understand how vegetation water and other factors affect the signal measured at satellite level and which wavelengths can provide a solution to the problem of retrieving vegetation water content from the satellite measurement. Since reflectance values measured at the satellite level result from the transfer of radiation through a system of three media, leaf, vegetation coupled with soil, and atmosphere, it is thus necessary to study the effects of 

## Designing the index

The theory behind the design of optimal spectral indices has been taken from the one described by Gobron et al. (1999), Govaerts et al. (1999), and Verstraete and Pinty (1996). A rational procedure to design the optimal index is to build on radiation transfer models of the associated leaf surface–atmosphere system to simulate sensor-like data sets over various representative land surfaces (Verstraete & Pinty, 1996). This approach defines a large number of simulated radiance fields, which can be 

## Conclusion

Using a GSA, we have quantified the importance of vegetation water content and other factors on reflectance measured at three levels (leaf, canopy, and atmosphere). We have demonstrated that variations in vegetation water content significantly affect the reflectance measured in the SWIR. We have also demonstrated that a combination of the SWIR and the NIR is required to retrieve vegetation water content. Using this information, an index was created that optimises the retrieval of vegetation

## Abstract

A series of experiments carried out in a controlled environment facility to induce steady-state chlorophyll _a_ fluorescence variation demonstrate that natural fluorescence emission is observable on the derivative reflectance spectra as a _double-peak_ feature in the 690–710 nm spectral region. This work describes that the unexplained _double-peak_ feature previously seen on canopy derivative reflectance is due entirely to [chlorophyll fluorescence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/chlorophyll-fluorescence "Learn more about chlorophyll fluorescence from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (CF) effects, demonstrating the importance of derivative methods for fluorescence detection in vegetation. Measurements were made in a controlled environmental chamber where temperature and humidity were varied through the time course of the experiments in both short- and long-term trials using _[Acer negundo](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/acer-negundo "Learn more about Acer negundo from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")_ ssp. [californium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/californium "Learn more about californium from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") canopies. Continuous [canopy reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/canopy-reflectance "Learn more about canopy reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") measurements were made with a spectrometer on healthy and stressed vegetation, along with leaf-level steady-state fluorescence measurements with the PAM-2000 Fluorometer during both temperature–stress induction and recovery stages. In 9-h trials, temperatures were ramped from 10 to 35 °C and [relative humidity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/relative-humidity "Learn more about relative humidity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") adjusted from 92% to 42% during stress induction, returning gradually to initial conditions during the recovery stage. Canopy reflectance difference calculations and derivative analysis of reflectance spectra demonstrate that a _double-peak_ feature created between 688, 697 and 710 nm on the derivative reflectance is a function of natural steady-state fluorescence emission, which gradually diminished with induction of maximum stress. Derivative reflectance indices based on this _double-peak_ feature are demonstrated to track natural steady-state fluorescence emission as quantified by two indices, the _double-peak_ index (DPi) and the area of the _double peak_ (_A_dp). Results obtained employing these _double-peak_ indices from canopy derivative reflectance suggest a potential for natural steady-state fluorescence detection with hyperspectral data. Short- and long-term stress effects on the observed _double-peak_ derivative indices due to pigment degradation and canopy structure changes were studied, showing that both indices are capable of tracking steady-state fluorescence changes from canopy [remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") reflectance.

## Introduction

Natural chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) occurs when red and far-red light is emitted from photosynthetic green plant tissues in response to photosynthetically active radiation. In the chloroplast, light energy is harvested and processed by two photosystems, which produce oxygen and energy through a series of oxidation–reduction reactions (see Ke, 2001). The importance of CF has been the subject of several reviews detailing theory, measurement methods and interpretation, its relationship with photosynthesis, and plant physiological status and photosynthetic functioning (e.g., Krause & Weis, 1984, Larcher, 1994, Lichtenthaler, 1992, Lichtenthaler & Rinderle, 1988, Papageorgiou, 1975, Schreiber & Bilger, 1987, Schreiber et al., 1994). When plants are exposed to excess light, CF is a protective process by which plant chloroplasts dissipate light energy that exceeds photosynthetic demands, thereby minimizing light-induced oxidative damage (see, e.g., Gilmore & Govindjee, 1999; and several chapters in Frank, Young, Britton, & Cogdell, 1999).

In general, steady-state CF and photosynthetic rates are inversely related, such that CF is low when photosynthesis is high. However, CF can also decline when photosynthesis is low, because of an intensified protective quenching action on CF production. Under increasing stress, plant tissues shift toward increasing heat production to dissipate excess energy, and this tends to have the effect of reducing CF production, at least in the initial and intermediate stages of stress (Yahyaoui, Harnois, & Carpentier, 1998). The interdependence of photosynthesis and CF, and the various mechanisms of CF quenching have been the subject of much research into the photobiology of a wide range of plant species Govindjee, 1995, Larcher, 1994, Lichtenthaler, 1992, Mohammed et al., 1995, Schreiber & Bilger, 1993.

The total amount of CF emitted by photosystems I (PS-I) and II (PS-II) is typically less than 5% of total light absorbed. Nevertheless, CF can be quantified with sensitive instrumentation in direct contact with the leaf tissue Bolhar-Nordenkampf et al., 1989, Mohammed et al., 1995, such as the family of instruments known as modulating fluorometers.

Accurate remote detection of natural CF would enable the measurement of canopy-level CF without being in direct contact with the vegetation canopy. Measurement of solar-induced natural fluorescence in vegetation canopies were reported by McFarlane et al. (1980), who measured solar-induced fluorescence in citrus canopies using the H-α Fraunhofer line at 656 nm, and Carter, Theisen, and Mitchell (1999) and Carter, Jones, Mitchell, and Brewer (1996) using the H-α and O2-B lines in leaf measurements. Buschmann and Lichtenthaler (1988) provided experimental evidence of a solar-induced fluorescence signal superimposed on leaf reflectance signatures. Additional studies suggested the effect of fluorescence on apparent reflectance (Gamon & Surfus, 1999), although the effect of the fluorescence signal on the apparent reflectance spectra of leaves was not quantified. Zarco-Tejada, Miller, Mohammed, and Noland (2000) demonstrated on a theoretical basis the CF effects on leaf-level reflectance and transmittance. These effects could be quantified using radiative transfer theory and a newly developed Fluorescence–Reflectance–Transmittance (FRT) leaf-level radiative transfer model. Subsequent studies demonstrated quantitatively that CF effects could be detected at the canopy level in the laboratory using light induction with cut-off filters, time-decay experiments, reflectance difference calculations, and optical indices from the reflectance spectra collected with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) Zarco-Tejada et al., 2000, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2001, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2002. These authors suggested that a _double-peak_ feature at 690–710 nm spectral region seen in the derivative reflectance was possibly due to the combined effects of fluorescence emission and low chlorophyll _a_+_b_ (C_a_+_b_) content on stressed vegetation, providing potentially important applications in vegetation stress detection using passive hyperspectral remote sensing methods. Although promising results were found on natural CF detection through canopy reflectance and derivative analysis, further research is needed under controlled conditions to demonstrate that the _double-peak_ feature seen on the canopy derivative reflectance is due solely to steady-state CF effects, and not to other confounding effects. Such derivative canopy reflectance methods would enable the remote sensing of small (about 3–5% of absorbed radiation) yet important natural CF at the canopy level, therefore facilitating the remote monitoring of photosynthetic functioning using passive hyperspectral sensors.

The experiments described here with small canopies in controlled conditions study the effects of steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence variation on canopy derivative reflectance, focusing on the _double-peak_ feature described above. Changes in the natural steady-state CF were induced in a series of experiments using a controlled temperature and humidity-regulated chamber with stable light conditions. These experiments enabled the study of reflectance changes as function of the variable natural fluorescence, monitoring the derivative reflectance measured with a spectrometer. This paper describes that the unexplained _double-peak_ feature previously seen on the canopy derivative reflectance is due entirely to chlorophyll fluorescence effects, demonstrating the importance of derivative methods for fluorescence detection in vegetation.

## Experimental methods and materials

Two small canopies of 2-year-old potted trees of _Acer negundo_ spp. californium of 1 m2 in size were used in the experiments carried out in a controlled environment facility. Temperature and humidity were varied in the controlled facility in order to test whether canopy reflectance and derivative analysis methods were able to track induced variations of steady-state CF. Below we describe the experimental procedures for the experiments and the methodology employed.

## Experimental results and discussion

Results of the data collection and analyses of fluorescence and canopy reflectance measurements are described here, showing the relationships found between derivative reflectance spectra and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements.

## Conclusions

Experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence effects are observable in canopy derivative reflectance through a _double-peak_ feature that is created in the 690–710 nm spectral region. Experiments were carried out on small canopies of _A. negundo_ in a controlled environment facility to induce stress through temperature and humidity variation. The experimental temperature ranged from 10 to 35 °C, with relative humidity varying inversely from 92% to 42%.




## Abstract

Statistical and radiative-transfer physically based studies have previously demonstrated the relationship between leaf water content and leaf-level reflectance in the near-infrared spectral region. The successful _scaling up_ of such methods to the canopy level requires modeling the effect of canopy structure and viewing geometry on reflectance bands and optical indices used for estimation of water content, such as normalized difference water index (NDWI), simple ratio water index (SRWI) and plant water index (PWI). This study conducts a [radiative transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiative-transfer "Learn more about radiative transfer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") simulation, linking leaf and canopy models, to study the effects of leaf structure, dry matter content, leaf area index (LAI), and the viewing geometry, on the estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness from canopy-level reflectance. The applicability of radiative transfer model inversion methods to [MODIS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/modis "Learn more about MODIS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is studied, investigating its spectral capability for water content estimation. A modeling study is conducted, simulating leaf and canopy MODIS-equivalent synthetic spectra with random input variables to test different inversion assumptions. A field sampling campaign to assess the investigated simulation methods was undertaken for analysis of leaf water content from leaf samples in 10 study sites of chaparral vegetation in California, [USA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/united-states-of-america "Learn more about USA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), between March and September 2000. MODIS reflectance data were processed from the same period for equivalent water thickness estimation by model inversion linking the PROSPECT leaf model and SAILH [canopy reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/canopy-reflectance "Learn more about canopy reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") model. MODIS reflectance data, viewing geometry values, and LAI were used as inputs in the model inversion for estimation of leaf equivalent water thickness, dry matter, and leaf structure. Results showed good correlation between the time series of MODIS-estimated equivalent water thickness and ground measured leaf fuel moisture (LFM) content (_r_2=0.7), demonstrating that these inversion methods could potentially be used for global monitoring of leaf water content in vegetation.

## Introduction

Quantitative estimation of leaf biochemical and canopy biophysical variables is a key element to the successful application of remote sensing in vegetation monitoring, a major goal in terrestrial ecology and a long-term research objective given the complexity of the vegetation canopies and phenomena Goetz et al., 1992, Verstraete et al., 1994. Accurate estimates of leaf pigments, nitrogen, dry matter, water content, and leaf area index (LAI) from remote sensing can assist in determining vegetation physiological status Carter, 1994, Peñuelas et al., 1994, the study of species and seasonal dependence (e.g., Belanger, Miller, & Boyer, 1995), and may serve as bioindicators of vegetation stress (e.g., Luther & Carroll, 1999, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2001). The remote determination of one of these biochemical constituents, vegetation water content, has important implications in agriculture and forestry (Gao & Goetz, 1995), it is essential for drought assessment in natural vegetation (Peñuelas, Filella, Biel, Serrano, & Savé, 1993), and it is a major driver in predicting the susceptibility to fire Chandler et al., 1983, Pyne et al., 1996, Ustin et al., 1998.

Several studies demonstrate the existing link between leaf-level reflectance in the 400–2500 nm spectral region and the amount of water in the leaf through optical indices, regression analysis and radiative transfer modeling Aldakheel & Danson, 1997, Allen et al., 1971, Carter, 1991, Carter, 1993, Ceccato et al., 2001, Danson et al., 1992, Gausman et al., 1970, Hunt et al., 1987, Jacquemoud & Baret, 1990. The primary and secondary effects of water content on leaf reflectance were studied by Carter (1991) showing that sensitivity of leaf reflectance to water content was greatest in spectral bands centered at 1450, 1940, and 2500 nm. Indirect effects of water content on reflectance were also found at 400 nm, in the red edge at 700 nm (Filella & Peñuelas, 1994) and on vegetation indices such as NDVI (Roberts, Green, & Adams, 1997). The effects of leaf structure on the water absorption bands were studied by Danson et al. (1992) showing that derivative reflectance calculated in the water absorption features minimized the effects due to leaf structure, therefore maximizing the sensitivity to leaf water content. Lately, the broad use of leaf radiative transfer models such as PROSPECT (Jacquemoud & Baret, 1990) for broadleaf species, LIBERTY (Dawson, Curran, & Plummer, 1998) based on radiative transfer characterization in needles, and LEAFMOD (Ganapol, Johnson, Hammer, Hlavka, & Peterson, 1998) among others, enable the simulation of the leaf optical properties as a function of leaf structural and biochemical constituents such as chlorophyll _a_+_b_ (_C_a+b), dry matter (_C_m), and leaf equivalent water thickness (_C_w).

Several research efforts focus on the application of leaf-level indices calculated from water-absorption bands, statistical relationships between leaf reflectance and leaf water content, and _scaling-up_ methods to canopy level through radiative transfer simulation. As an example, airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery was used to derive equivalent water thickness in vegetation using nonlinear and linear least squares spectral matching techniques, achieving good agreements with ground measured leaf fuel moisture (LFM) content (Gao & Goetz, 1995). In other studies, Pinzón, Ustin, Castañeda, and Smith (1998) and Ustin et al. (1998) using hierarchical foreground/background analysis (HFBA) showed general success retrieving equivalent water thickness by radiative transfer modeling using the 960-nm absorption band, but breaking down for low LAI canopies due to the increasing effects of soil background and shadows on sparse vegetation. Other ratios, such as the plant water index (PWI, _R_970/_R_900) (Peñuelas, Piñol, Ogaya, & Filella, 1997) was used to map vegetation water content with AVIRIS imagery, but found to be affected not only by water content, but also by canopy structure and viewing geometry (Serrano, Ustin, Roberts, Gamon, & Peñuelas, 2000) therefore highly dependent on bi-directional and geometrical effects of the vegetation canopy. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) calculated as (_R_860−_R_1240)/(_R_860+_R_1240) was suggested by Gao (1996) in a theoretical study, demonstrating its potential applicability for canopy-level water content estimation based on the liquid water absorption band centered at 1240 nm enhanced by canopy scattering. Nevertheless, Zarco-Tejada and Ustin (2001) showed in a simulation study the dependency of NDWI and the simple ratio water index (SRWI, _R_858/_R_1240) on leaf-level variables such as leaf structure and dry matter content, and most importantly, on canopy LAI.

These partially successful results, obtained when estimating vegetation water content, demonstrate the need for modeling efforts to account for leaf and canopy variables and the viewing geometry. Efforts to investigate the successful _scaling up_ of optical indices from leaf to canopy level through radiative transfer simulation Haboudane et al., 2002, Zarco-Tejada et al., 1999, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2001 show the importance of these methods when estimating leaf biochemical constituents from canopy reflectance data. Nevertheless, few investigations are found which apply these radiative transfer methods and model inversion techniques for leaf water content estimation from canopy reflectance imagery. Examples are the simulation studies to estimate equivalent water thickness by model inversion by Jacquemoud, Baret, Andrieu, Danson, and Jaggard (1995), Jacquemoud et al. (1996) and Fourty and Baret (1997) linking the PROSPECT leaf model (Jacquemoud & Baret, 1990) and SAIL canopy model (Verhoef, 1984), showing successful retrievals of _C_w from continuous hyperspectral (AVIRIS-simulated) and multispectral (TM-simulated) spectra taking into account leaf- and canopy-level variables. Recently, Ceccato, Flasse, and Grégoire (2002) and Ceccato, Gobron, Flasse, Pinty, and Tarantola (2002) developed an optical index for SPOT-VEGETATION sensor based on global sensitivity analysis using radiative transfer models.

The work presented here investigates the applicability of these radiative transfer techniques to MODIS reflectance data for vegetation water content estimation. A simulation study with synthetic spectra and MODIS-equivalent reflectance is presented, investigating the spectral capabilities of MODIS for estimating leaf equivalent water thickness by inversion of a linked leaf–canopy model. Further, a seasonal field study was undertaken for leaf sampling and analysis of LFM content from 10 study sites, measuring fresh and dry weight of leaf samples. Time-series of MODIS reflectance spectra from the study sites during the period of the field experiment were used for model inversion to estimate equivalent water thickness by radiative transfer simulation.

## Abstract

Nonnative [plant species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/plant-specie "Learn more about plant species from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are causing enormous ecological and environmental impacts from local to global scale. [Remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about Remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") images have had mixed success in providing spatial information on [land cover](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/land-cover "Learn more about land cover from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") characteristics to land managers that increase effective management of invasions into native habitats. However, there has been limited evaluation of the use of hyperspectral data and processing techniques for mapping specific [invasive species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/invasive-species "Learn more about invasive species from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") based on their spectral characteristics. This research evaluated three different methods of processing [hyperspectral imagery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/hyperspectral-imagery "Learn more about hyperspectral imagery from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"): minimum noise fraction (MNF), continuum removal, and band [ratio indices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/indexes-ratios "Learn more about ratio indices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for mapping iceplant (_[Carpobrotus edulis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/carpobrotus-edulis "Learn more about Carpobrotus edulis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")_) and jubata grass (_Cortaderia jubata_) in California's coastal habitat. Validation with field sampling data showed high mapping accuracies for all methods for identifying presence or absence of iceplant (97%), with the MNF procedure producing the highest accuracy (55%) when the classes were divided into four different densities of iceplant.

## Introduction

One of the most significant threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is the spread of invasive plant species (Mooney & Cleland, 2001). Continuing anthropogenic related disturbances, such as land conversion, grazing, and habitat fragmentation, combined with international trade and climate change indicate that these trends are likely to continue (Zedler & Scheid, 1988). In this context, the major challenge for land managers and ecologists is how to effectively manage nonnative plants to preserve native biodiversity. Being able to delineate the spatial extent and to ascertain the severity or intensity of the invasion is essential for resource management (Byers et al., 2002). This information provides a baseline for monitoring future expansion, the effectiveness of control efforts, and assists in identifying targets for control activities such as satellite populations and ‘invasion fronts.’

Techniques, such as remote sensing, offer significant opportunities for providing timely information on invasions of nonnative species into native habitats. In contrast to field-based surveys, imagery can be acquired for all habitats, over a much larger spatial area, and in a short period of time. Consequently, researchers have sought to exploit unique phenological, spectral, or structural characteristics of the nonnative species in the image to distinguish them from the mosaic of species around them. To date, there have been two divergent approaches. First, the use of imagery with a high spatial, but low spectral resolution such as black and white or color infrared aerial photographs. Second, the use of digital images with greater spectral resolution although coarser spatial resolution.

Aerial photographs have the benefit of being relatively inexpensive with large amounts of archival data available for many sites and typically have very fine spatial resolution (0.1–2 m). Aerial photography techniques have capitalized on unique visual characteristics at particular times in the focal species' lifecycle. For example, Chinese tamarisk (_Tamarix chinensis_) has been identified using the unique orange-brown color prior to leaf drop (Everitt, Escobar, Alaniz, Davis, & Richerson, 1996), while leafy spurge (_Euphorbia esula_) has distinctive yellow bracts which appear with flowering in late May (Everitt et al., 1995). However, the major disadvantage of this approach is that it relies on the nonnative plant possessing visually detectable unique characteristics as well as requiring extensive manual labor for processing. Manual tasks include, for example, digitizing and georegistering of imagery as well as time-intensive interpretation requiring both skill and experience Anderson et al., 1993, Everitt et al., 1995. Finally, the resolution of the imagery, along with the associated manual processing time, means that it is only feasible to collect data over a relatively small spatial area.

In contrast, the use of digital multispectral imagery offers the opportunity for automated image processing, access to recent historical data for time series analyses, and large spatial coverage. Some studies have had success even using coarse-resolution (1.1 km pixel) advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) imagery to identify weeds. For example, Peters, Reed, Eve, and McDaniel (1992) identified moderate to heavy infestations of broom snakeweed (_Gutierezia sarothrae_) with an average cover>9% in a 4×4 km site. This species was distinguished from grasslands using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979) due to differences in phenological activity. However, successful mapping at this scale has been limited by the coarse resolution and the number of spectral bands (2) of AVHRR. At higher spatial and spectral resolution Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) imagery (30 m pixels) was used to predict the distribution of dyers woad (_Isatis tinctoria_) (Dewey, Price, & Ramsey, 1991). Known infestations were mapped and correlated with brightness, greenness, and wetness values derived from the reflectance data. Finally, airborne data acquisition and registration (ADAR) data at 1 m resolution has successfully distinguished different densities of yellow hawkweed (_Hieracium pratense_) invasion using supervised and unsupervised classification techniques (Carson, Lass, & Callihan, 1995). However, the spatial resolutions of TM, like AVHRR imagery, mean that invasive species populations can often only be detected after they become dense and widespread (Carson et al., 1995). In addition, traditional classification techniques, such as isodata or maximum likelihood, usually identify vulnerable land cover classes, rather than the nonnative species itself; consequently, maps have only a general applicability.

The availability of airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery with increased spatial and, more critically, fine spectral resolution, offers an enhanced potential for mapping invasive species. Because of the large number of wavebands (224), image processing is able to capitalize on both the biochemical and the structural properties of the target invader. The need for exploring these spectral properties is particularly important when we consider the limitations of using traditionally available wavebands; for example, with color infrared, green vegetation is observed as shades of red. This is seen in Fig. 1, where the majority of land cover appears as ‘green vegetation’; thus, identification of individual species, including invasive species, which dominate the coastal margin is impossible, even at 4 m pixel resolutions. However, to date, there has been little evaluation of different processing techniques that take advantage of imaging spectrometry data for identifying invasive plants. The objective of this research is to investigate the use of AVIRIS imagery to detect the invasive species iceplant (_Carpobrotus edulis_) and jubata grass (_Cortaderia jubata_) and, more specifically, to compare three techniques for processing the imagery: minimum noise fraction (MNF), continuum removal, and band ratio indices.

The minimum noise fraction is a linear transformation that consists of two separate principle component analysis (PCA) rotations, separating noise from signal and compressing spectral information to a few bands (Green, Berman, Switzer, & Craig, 1988). As a standard image-processing technique, we are interested in assessing how well it performs for identifying our focal species. Band ratio indices create new spectral bands which are useful for emphasizing certain physiologically important features. For example, NDVI has been used for mapping green vegetation, while at the leaf and the stand scales the red/green ratio and water band indices have been used to describe relative levels of anthocyanin and water, respectively Peñuelas et al., 1997, Gamon & Surfus, 1999. In this study we investigate whether vegetation indices can capture the characteristics of a specific species within a mosaic of other vegetation. Finally, we seek to assess the potential of simply using an analysis of the water absorption bands to map weeds. The continuum removal technique isolates spectral features and standardizes reflectance across the liquid water absorption features so that they may be intercompared (Clark & Roush, 1984). The advantage is that values are independent of differences across the image such as illumination or shadow. These three processes were compared for their ability to delineate the spatial extent and the density of iceplant and jubata grass and also to critically evaluate the relative ease of processing and repeatability of each method.

## Study site and vegetation descriptions

The study site for this research is Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) located along the central coast of California (Fig. 2). VAFB is 39,800 ha and is used primarily for developing and testing missiles and satellite launches for the Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Consequently, significantly large intact blocks of land remain in one of the last undeveloped open areas of coastal California (Keil & Holland, 1998). There are 836 vascular plants

## Results

A visual comparison of the three classification results Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 shows that iceplant is clearly distinguished in all analyses with a similar spatial configuration: highest densities parallel to the coastline and tapering off with increasing distance inland (in a northeast direction). Separation of different density levels of iceplant is evident in all three images. Field validation was undertaken in August 2001 to obtain ocular cover estimates by species of the classification

## Discussion

Effective management of invasive species requires accurate knowledge of their spatial distribution and density, which are captured to different degrees by the processing methods. The following discussion evaluates the three approaches in terms of accuracy, logistics of processing, and ease of interpretation, which are all necessary considerations for management.

The confusion matrices demonstrate that the MNF performed best for classifying all five vegetation communities within the flightline;

## Conclusion

This research describes encouraging findings for using hyperspectral imagery to map iceplant and jubata grass in California's Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Given the ecological and economic impacts of invasive plants, together with their rates of spread, they constitute one of the most critical issues for many land managers (Goodall & Naude, 1998). The immediate benefit of this research has been to contribute to the knowledge base of land managers at VAFB by providing improved information on

# Derivation of a shortwave infrared water stress index from MODIS near- and shortwave infrared data in a semiarid environment

## Abstract

Two different configurations of a shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) are derived from the [MODIS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/modis "Learn more about MODIS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") near- and shortwave infrared data. A large absorption by leaf water occurs in the shortwave infrared wavelengths (SWIR) and the reflectance from plants thereby is negatively related to leaf water content. Two configurations of a water stress index, SIWSI(6,2) and SIWSI(5,2) are derived on a daily basis from the MODIS satellite data using the information from the near infrared (NIR) channel 2 (841–876 nm) and the shortwave infrared channel 5 (1230–1250 nm) or 6 (1628–1652 nm), respectively, which are wavelength bands at which leaf water content influence the radiometric response. The indices are compared to in situ top layer soil moisture measurements from the semiarid Senegal 2001 and 2002, serving as an indicator of canopy water content. The year 2001 rainfall in the region was slightly below average and the results show a strong correlation between SIWSI and soil moisture. The SIWSI(6,2) performs slightly better than the SIWSI(5,2) (_r_2=0.87 and 0.79). The [fieldwork](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/fieldwork "Learn more about fieldwork from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in 2002 did not verify the results found in 2001. However, year 2002 was an extremely dry year and the vegetation cover apparently was too sparse to provide information on the canopy water content. To test the robustness of the SIWSI findings in 2001, soil moisture has been modelled from daily rainfall data at 10 sites in the central and northern part of Senegal. The correlations between SIWSI and simulated soil moisture are generally high with a median _r_2=0.72 for both configurations of the SIWSI. It is therefore suggested that the combined information from the MODIS near- and shortwave infrared wavelengths is useful as an indicator of canopy water stress in the semiarid Sahelian environment.

## Introduction

In the drylands of the Sahelian zone in West Africa, management of vegetation resources is of key importance. Since the 1970s, this zone has been characterized by erratic climatic changes/fluctuations having profound impacts on the natural ecosystems and the agricultural production. Proper management of natural resources in this zone requires regular information on the seasonal development and variation in a range of biophysical parameters but because of limited availability of monitoring network in these areas it is a difficult task. Considering the varying spatial and temporal range of these biophysical parameters, it is evident that the use of repetitive accurate Earth Observation (EO) data is the only realistic means of acquiring much of this information. During the last decades, much focus has been placed on the modelling of biophysical variables from EO surface reflectance data aiming at monitoring the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems (net primary production, NPP) and concurrently with the rapid development of satellite sensor design the accuracy of the derivation of biophysical variables have also improved considerably. New satellite sensors like MODIS sensor, flying aboard NASA's TERRA satellite and the MERIS carried by the European ENVISAT have been substantially improved on the subject of spectral and spatial resolution compared to the widely used NOAA AVHRR.

When modelling net primary production (NPP) in a semiarid environment like the Sahelian zone canopy, water stress is a key variable. NPP has traditionally been assessed using the light use efficiency approach (LUE) but without information on canopy water stress the LUE approach provides an estimate of potential rather than actual production. Canopy water stress has proved to be difficult to derive from conventional EO data. However, the spectral configuration on the MODIS sensor open up the possibilities of the derivation of a shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) on a daily basis using the information from the shortwave infrared channel 5 (1230–1250 nm) or 6 (1628–1652 nm), which are wavelength areas at which leaf water content influence the radiometric response. In this paper, two different configurations of the SIWSI are derived from the MODIS near- and shortwave infrared data. The indices are compared to in situ top layer soil moisture measurements from the semiarid Senegal 2001 and 2002, serving as an indicator of canopy water content. Soil moisture is furthermore modelled from daily rainfall data to be able to test the SIWSIs against soil moisture for a larger number of locations than the fieldwork sites.

## Abstract

A growing number of studies have focused on evaluating spectral indices in terms of their sensitivity to vegetation biophysical parameters, as well as to external factors affecting [canopy reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/canopy-reflectance "Learn more about canopy reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). In this context, leaf and canopy [radiative transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiative-transfer "Learn more about radiative transfer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") models are valuable for modeling and understanding the behavior of such indices. In the present work, PROSPECT and SAILH models have been used to simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances in an attempt to study the sensitivity of a set of [vegetation indices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/vegetation-index "Learn more about vegetation indices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to green leaf area index (LAI), and to modify some of them in order to enhance their responsivity to LAI variations. The aim of the paper was to present a method for minimizing the effect of leaf chlorophyll content on the prediction of green LAI, and to develop new algorithms that adequately predict the LAI of crop canopies. Analyses based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of existing [vegetation indices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/vegetation-index "Learn more about vegetation indices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index [RDVI], Modified Simple Ratio [MSR], Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index [SAVI], Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index [SARVI], MSAVI, Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI], and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption [Ratio Index](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/indexes-ratios "Learn more about Ratio Index from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [MCARI]) and to design new ones (MTVI1, MCARI1, MTVI2, and MCARI2) that are both less sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and linearly related to green LAI. Thorough analyses showed that the above existing vegetation indices were either sensitive to chlorophyll concentration changes or affected by saturation at high LAI levels. Conversely, two of the spectral indices developed as a part of this study, a modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) and a modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI2), proved to be the best predictors of green LAI. Related predictive algorithms were tested on CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) [hyperspectral images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/hyperspectral-image "Learn more about hyperspectral images from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and, then, validated using ground truth measurements. The latter were collected simultaneously with image acquisition for different crop types (soybean, [corn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/maize "Learn more about corn from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and wheat), at different growth stages, and under various fertilization treatments. Prediction power analysis of proposed algorithms based on MCARI2 and MTVI2 resulted in agreements between modeled and ground measurement of non-destructive LAI, with coefficients of determination (_r_2) being 0.98 for soybean, 0.89 for corn, and 0.74 for wheat. The corresponding [RMSE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/root-mean-square-error "Learn more about RMSE from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for LAI were estimated at 0.28, 0.46, and 0.85, respectively.

## Introduction

Green leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable used by crop physiologists and modelers for estimating foliage cover, as well as forecasting crop growth and yield. Its determination is critical for understanding biophysical processes of forest and crop canopies and for predicting their growth and productivity Daughtry et al., 1992, Goetz & Prince, 1996, Liu et al., 1997, Moran et al., 1995, Moran et al., 1997, Tucker et al., 1980. The expression “green LAI”, used in this paper, represents the LAI of living leaves regardless to their photosynthetic capacity. Living leaves can have similar structural characteristics but various pigment contents (i.e., chlorophyll). The exposed area of living leaves plays a key role in various biophysical processes such as plant transpiration and CO2 exchange. These functions are important for understanding exchanges between the vegetation and the atmosphere. Because LAI is functionally linked to the canopy spectral reflectance, its retrieval from remote sensing data has prompted many investigations and studies in recent years. This has led to the development of different techniques aiming to improve its estimation over large areas, mainly through the use of spectral indices, model inversions, and spectral mixture analysis. The latter has been successfully used to define an end-member of interest, determine its relative abundance, then correlate it with ground-measured LAI; thus, more or less significant correlation levels were found between LAI and sunlit fraction (Hu et al., 2004), shadow fraction (Peddle & Johnson, 2000), and crop fraction (Pacheco et al., 2001). Only very few studies have focused on inversion of sophisticated radiative transfer models to retrieve green LAI of crop canopies (Jacquemoud et al., 2000). The common and widely used approach has been to develop relationships between ground-measured LAI and vegetation indices Chen & Cihlar, 1996, Fassnacht et al., 1997, Spanner et al., 1990. Consequently, a large number of relationships have been established, and a wide range of determination coefficients (0.05<_r_2<0.66) between satellite-derived spectral indices and LAI were found Baret & Guyot, 1991, Brown et al., 2000, Chen, 1996.

During recent decades, substantial efforts were expended in improving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and in developing new indices aiming to compensate for soil background influences Bannari et al., 1996, Baret et al., 1989, Huete, 1988, Qi et al., 1994, Rondeaux et al., 1996, as well as for atmospheric effects Karnieli et al., 2001, Kaufman & Tanre, 1992. Even though the external perturbing factors related to changes in soil brightness and atmospheric conditions were taken into account, vegetation indices still have definite intrinsic limitations; they are not a single measure of a specific variable of interest such as pigment content, plant geometry, or canopy architecture. So far, it has not been possible to design an index which is sensitive only to the desired variable and totally insensitive to all other vegetation parameters (Govaerts et al., 1999). Therefore, different indices were defined for different purposes, and optimized to assess a process of interest. For instance, some spectral indices were proposed to capture the photochemical processes associated with photosynthesis activity such as light use efficiency or to estimate leaf pigment content Broge & Leblanc, 2000, Chappelle et al., 1992, Daughtry et al., 2000, Gamon et al., 1992, Haboudane et al., 2002, Kim et al., 1994. Others were designed to retrieve LAI Brown et al., 2000, Chen, 1996 or to quantify vegetation fraction (Gitelson et al., 2001).

A major problem in the use of these indices arises from the fact that canopy reflectance, in the visible and near-infrared, is strongly dependent on both structural (e.g., LAI) and biochemical properties (e.g., chlorophyll) of the canopy Goel, 1988, Jacquemoud et al., 2000, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2001. Moreover, LAI and chlorophyll content have similar effects on canopy reflectance particularly in the spectral region from the green (550 nm) to the red edge (750 nm). To uncouple their combined effect, recent studies Daughtry et al., 2000, Haboudane et al., 2002 have demonstrated that leaf chlorophyll content can be estimated with minimal confounding effects due to LAI through a combination of two kinds of spectral indices: indices sensitive to pigment concentration and indices resistant to soil optical properties influence. Conversely, no studies have focused on the retrieval of LAI without interference of chlorophyll effects. The latter generate a considerable scatter in the relationship between LAI and the vegetation index of choice.

In practice, LAI prediction from remotely sensed data faces two major difficulties: (1) vegetation indices approach a saturation level asymptotically when LAI exceeds 2 to 5, depending on the type of vegetation index; (2) there is no unique relationship between LAI and a vegetation index of choice, but rather a family of relationships, each a function of chlorophyll content and/or other canopy characteristics. To address these issues, a few studies have been carried out to assess and compare various vegetation indices in terms of their stability and their prediction power of LAI Baret & Guyot, 1991, Broge & Leblanc, 2000 while others have dealt with modifying some vegetation indices to improve their linearity with, and increase their sensitivity to, LAI Chen, 1996, Brown et al., 2000, Nemani et al., 1993. Consequently, some indices have been identified as best estimators of LAI because they are less sensitive to the variation of external parameters affecting the spectral reflectance of the canopy, namely soil optical properties, illumination geometry, and atmospheric conditions. However, the effect of leaf chlorophyll variations on the LAI–vegetation index relationship remains an unsolved problem. How does chlorophyll concentration influence the behavior of a vegetation index of choice? Which of these indices, suitable to LAI prediction, is least sensitive to chlorophyll changes? Is there a single LAI versus vegetation index curve for a wide range of leaf chlorophyll content?

The need for an answer to these questions has inspired the present study as a contribution to improving the use of hyperspectral remote sensing to predict LAI in the context of precision farming. The main purpose is to suggest a spectral index that is suitable to simply, and yet accurately, determine LAI of crop canopies for agriculture management purposes. The research focuses on reducing the variability in LAI estimates due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. To achieve these objectives, PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models were used to simulate crop canopy reflectance for various biochemical, structural and observation conditions, then a set of indices that have proven to be resistant to atmospheric and soil brightness effects were assessed in terms of their responsivity/resistance to chlorophyll content variability. Another objective was to validate the modeling approach through the application to airborne hyperspectral data and the comparison with field measurements carried out simultaneously with image acquisition.

## The study area

The study area is located at the former Greenbelt Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (45°18′N, 75°45′W, Ottawa, Canada). Over three successive years, different crops (corn, wheat, soybean) were grown on a 30-ha field with a drained clay loam soil as well as on adjacent fields managed by private producers. Prior knowledge of the field management and plant stress patterns helped in selecting ground truth sites of contrasting productivity in order to test the performance of predictive

## Sensitivity to chlorophyll effects and saturation level: simulated data

The relationships between vegetation indices and green LAI are not unique, they exhibit a considerable scatter caused by chlorophyll content variation and/or the influence of other canopy characteristics. In fact, the indices are designed to measure vegetation greenness in which chlorophyll content plays a major role beside the amount of green leaves. To understand this influence, vegetation indices selected for this study are plotted against green LAI as a function of chlorophyll

## Conclusions

Quantification of the canopy leaf area index (LAI) and its spatial distribution provides an avenue to improve the interpretation of remotely sensed data over vegetated areas, as well as valuable information to aid the development of approaches for ecosystem functioning and ecosystem productivity. Due to the complexity of the relationship between canopy reflectance and its biochemical components and structural descriptors, the present study used the radiative transfer model, PROSPECT and SAILH,

The need for an answer to these questions has inspired the present study as a contribution to improving the use of hyperspectral remote sensing to predict LAI in the context of precision farming. The main purpose is to suggest a spectral index that is suitable to simply, and yet accurately, determine LAI of crop canopies for agriculture management purposes. The research focuses on reducing the variability in LAI estimates due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. To achieve these objectives, PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models were used to simulate crop canopy reflectance for various biochemical, structural and observation conditions, then a set of indices that have proven to be resistant to atmospheric and soil brightness effects were assessed in terms of their responsivity/resistance to chlorophyll content variability. Another objective was to validate the modeling approach through the application to airborne hyperspectral data and the comparison with field measurements carried out simultaneously with image acquisition.

## The study area

The study area is located at the former Greenbelt Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (45°18′N, 75°45′W, Ottawa, Canada). Over three successive years, different crops (corn, wheat, soybean) were grown on a 30-ha field with a drained clay loam soil as well as on adjacent fields managed by private producers. Prior knowledge of the field management and plant stress patterns helped in selecting ground truth sites of contrasting productivity in order to test the performance of predictive

## Sensitivity to chlorophyll effects and saturation level: simulated data

The relationships between vegetation indices and green LAI are not unique, they exhibit a considerable scatter caused by chlorophyll content variation and/or the influence of other canopy characteristics. In fact, the indices are designed to measure vegetation greenness in which chlorophyll content plays a major role beside the amount of green leaves. To understand this influence, vegetation indices selected for this study are plotted against green LAI as a function of chlorophyll

## Conclusions

Quantification of the canopy leaf area index (LAI) and its spatial distribution provides an avenue to improve the interpretation of remotely sensed data over vegetated areas, as well as valuable information to aid the development of approaches for ecosystem functioning and ecosystem productivity. Due to the complexity of the relationship between canopy reflectance and its biochemical components and structural descriptors, the present study used the radiative transfer model, PROSPECT and SAILH,

## Abstract

Hyperspectral data acquired by the Hyperion instrument, on board the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite, were evaluated for the discrimination of five important Brazilian sugarcane varieties (RB72-454, SP80-1816, SP80-1842, SP81-3250, and SP87-365). The radiance values were converted into [surface reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/surface-reflectance "Learn more about surface reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") images by a MODTRAN4-based technique. To discriminate varieties with similar reflectance values, multiple [discriminant analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/discriminant-analysis "Learn more about discriminant analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (MDA) was applied over the data. To obtain an adequate [discriminant function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/discriminant-analysis-statistics "Learn more about discriminant function from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), a stepwise method was used to select the best variables among surface reflectance values, ratios of reflectance, and several spectral indices potentially sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content, leaf water, and lignin-cellulose. Results showed that the five Brazilian sugarcane varieties were discriminated using EO-1 Hyperion data. Differences in [canopy architecture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/canopy-architecture "Learn more about canopy architecture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") affected sunlight penetration and reflectance, resulting in a higher reflectance for planophile (e.g., SP81-3250) than erectophile (e.g., SP80-1842) sugarcane plants. The variety SP80-1842 presented lower reflectance values, deeper lignin-cellulose absorption bands at 2103 nm and 2304 nm, shallower leaf liquid water absorption bands at 983 nm and 1205 nm, and lower leaf liquid water content than the other sugarcane varieties. To discriminate this cultivar, a single near-infrared (NIR) band threshold was used. To discriminate the other four sugarcane varieties with similar reflectance values, MDA was used producing a classification accuracy of 87.5% for a hold-out set of pixels. The comparison between the ground truth data and the MDA-derived [classification image](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/image-classification "Learn more about classification image from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") confirmed the model' capacity to differentiate the varieties accurately. The best results were obtained for the cultivar SP87-365 that presented the lowest spectral variability in the discriminant space. Some misclassified areas were associated with the cultivars SP80-1816 and SP81-3250 that showed the highest spectral variability.

## Introduction

Brazil is the largest world producer of sugarcane (_Saccharum_ spp.) with more than 4.5 million hectares planted in the southeastern and northeastern regions of the country (Unica, 2004). The state of São Paulo, located in southeastern Brazil, was responsible for 60% of the Brazilian production in 2002/2003 (Rudorff et al., 2004, Unica, 2004). In Brazil, sugarcane is used to obtain sugar, anhydrous alcohol (gasoline additive) and hydrated alcohol (natural, clean and renewable pure fuel for vehicles) for the internal and external markets (Oliveira, 2002). Steam, derived from sugarcane burning bagasse, is also employed to generate electrical power.

To improve the efficiency of the Brazilian industry, new sugarcane varieties with higher yields are continuously developed and tested. An ideal sugarcane variety should be well adapted to local variations in climate, soil type and cutting system (manual or mechanized) or ratooning (Badaloo et al., 1999, Bissessur et al., 2000, Torres et al., 1998). It should be resistant to pests, diseases and water stress, and it should have high concentrations of sucrose in the storage tissue (Croft et al., 2000, Raizer & Vencovsky, 1999). Sugarcane farmers often replace old sugarcane varieties for newer varieties. Thus, the mapping of the sugarcane varieties is very important for yield prediction and crop damage risk assessment.

Remote sensing investigations in sugarcane plantations are usually related to classification and mapping (e.g., Tardin et al., 1992), crop management (e.g., Fiorio et al., 2000, Wiegand et al., 1996, Yang et al., 1997), and yield estimation (e.g., Rudorff & Batista, 1990). However, most of the remote sensing studies to discriminate varieties were performed with other crops (e.g., Daughtry & Walthall, 1998, Hansen & Schjoerring, 2003, Pinter et al., 1985).

Hyperspectral instruments, such as the Hyperion (242 bands) on board the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) spacecraft, allow the identification of vegetation absorption features that are not identified by multispectral sensors (Huete et al., 2003, Roberts et al., 2003). Furthermore, in relation to multispectral sensors, they provide an enhanced level of information for atmospheric correction (Datt et al., 2003). By collecting data from an orbital level, potential applications derived from the use of airborne imaging spectrometers can also be tested over a wide range of environmental conditions (Asner & Heidebrecht, 2003). Although there are several examples of the study of crops with different hyperspectral instruments (e.g., Champagne et al., 2003, Goel et al., 2003, Haboudane et al., 2002, LaCapra et al., 1996, Lelong et al., 1998, Ogunjemiyo et al., 2002), only a few investigations are related to sugarcane plantations. For example, narrow band indices derived from Hyperion data were used by Apan et al. (2004) to detect sugarcane disease in Australia.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of the EO-1 Hyperion instrument to discriminate five important sugarcane varieties in the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The main hypothesis was that cultivar-related agronomical differences (e.g., canopy architecture) produce different spectral responses that can be detected with high spectral resolution sensors. For this purpose, surface reflectance values, ratios of reflectance, and several existing spectral indices which are potentially sensitive to changes in chlorophyll, leaf liquid water, and lignin-cellulose were considered in the analysis.

## Hyperion imagery

The study area in the state of São Paulo (upper left corner=47°25′46″W, 20°32′52″S; lower right corner=47°27′10″W, 20°58′41″S) is dominated by Oxisols. According to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (Embrapa, 1999), two major soil types predominate: Latossolo Vermelho (Acriférrico, Distroférrico, and Distrófico) and Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo (Acriférrico and Distrófico).

Hyperion data were acquired on July 16, 2002, at the peak of the regional dry season and sugarcane harvest, with a

Fig. 1a shows a true color composite of the study area with the Hyperion bands centred at 671 nm (red), 569 nm (green) and 478 nm (blue). Fig. 1b shows a false color composite (bands at 864 nm, 1649 nm and 2204 nm in red, green and blue colors, respectively) with an indication of the areas representative of the five sugarcane varieties under study. In Fig. 1b, areas in cyan represent non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) or litter derived from sugarcane harvest just before the image acquisition.

## Conclusions

The five Brazilian sugarcane varieties under study were discriminated with EO-1 Hyperion data using reflectance values, ratios of reflectance and several spectral indices sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content, leaf water and lignin-cellulose. Differences in canopy architecture affected sunlight penetration and reflectance, resulting in a higher reflectance for planophile (e.g., SP81-3250) than erectophile (e.g., SP80-1842) sugarcane plants. The cultivar SP80-1842 was the most easily

## Abstract

This article aims at finding efficient hyperspectral indices for the estimation of forest sun leaf chlorophyll content (CHL, µg cmleaf− 2), sun leaf mass per area (LMA, gdry matter mleaf− 2), canopy leaf area index (LAI, m2leaf msoil− 2) and leaf canopy biomass (Bleaf, gdry matter msoil− 2). These parameters are useful inputs for forest ecosystem simulations at landscape scale. The method is based on the determination of the best [vegetation indices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/vegetation-index "Learn more about vegetation indices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (index form and wavelengths) using the [radiative transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiative-transfer "Learn more about radiative transfer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") model PROSAIL (formed by the newly-calibrated leaf reflectance model PROSPECT coupled with the multi-layer version of the canopy radiative transfer model SAIL). The results are tested on experimental measurements at both leaf and canopy scales. At the leaf scale, it is possible to estimate CHL with high precision using a two wavelength vegetation index after a simulation based calibration. At the leaf scale, the LMA is more difficult to estimate with indices. At the canopy scale, efficient indices were determined on a generic simulated database to estimate CHL, LMA, LAI and Bleaf in a general way. These indices were then applied to two Hyperion images (50 plots) on the Fontainebleau and Fougères forests and portable [spectroradiometer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/spectroradiometers "Learn more about spectroradiometer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") measurements. They showed good results with an [RMSE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/root-mean-square-error "Learn more about RMSE from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of 8.2 µg cm− 2 for CHL, 9.1 g m− 2 for LMA, 1.7 m2 m− 2 for LAI and 50.6 g m− 2 for Bleaf. However, at the canopy scale, even if the wavelengths of the calibrated indices were accurately determined with the simulated database, the regressions between the indices and the biophysical characteristics still had to be calibrated on measurements. At the canopy scale, the best indices were: for leaf chlorophyll content: NDchl = (_ρ_925 − _ρ_710)/(_ρ_925 + _ρ_710), for leaf mass per area: NDLMA = (_ρ_2260 − _ρ_1490)/(_ρ_2260 + _ρ_1490), for leaf area index: DLAI = _ρ_1725 − _ρ_970, and for canopy leaf biomass: NDBleaf = (_ρ_2160 − _ρ_1540)/(_ρ_2160 + _ρ_1540).

## Introduction

Forest ecosystems are well-studied at the stand scale. However, in order to better understand their functioning and response to environmental changes, it is necessary to up-scale this knowledge to the scale of the entire forest or small region (Landsberg, 2003, Makela et al., 2000). One way to reach this objective is to use ecosystem models that are validated with local-scale observations and applied to larger areas. For a large scale simulation, a selection of spatially-parameterized input parameters is necessary. The selection of the main spatial parameters should meet the following criteria (le Maire et al., 2005):

- (i)
    
    to be a parameter to whish the model is sensitive,
    
- (ii)
    
    to be spatially variable at the scale of interest (for instance between stands), and to have a larger variability at this scale than at finer scale (e.g., inter-stand vs. intra-stand variability),
    
- (ii)
    
    to have a non-linear model response: this strengthens the need for spatialization of the parameter if the simulation results are averaged.
    

A study with a particular forest process-based ecosystem model has shown that a number of parameters are sensitive in this model (Dufrêne et al., 2005). Many of these parameters are spatially variable between stands, some of them having a non-linear response (Davi et al., 2006). Among these parameters, in addition to soil parameters driving the soil water budget, the following vegetation parameters were identified:

- –
    
    leaf nitrogen content (Nleaf), which is directly involved in the photosynthesis calculation. Experimental measurements have shown that this parameter is highly correlated with leaf chlorophyll content (CHL, µg cm− 2) for sun leaves (see Section 4.7),
    
- –
    
    annual maximum leaf mass per area (LMA) of sun leaves (leaves of the canopy that are not shadowed by other leaves), a parameter that enables conversion of leaf area to leaf biomass (Bleaf), which is used in many processes in the model,
    
- –
    
    annual maximum leaf area index (LAI), which drives many processes like radiation interception, canopy photosynthesis and litter amount.
    

The objective of the present study is to assess the possibility of estimating essential parameters of forest ecosystem models (LMA, LAI, CHL and Bleaf) using hyperspectral satellite images on large areas, and to estimate the obtained accuracy.

The use of indices on hyperspectral images has two major advantages. First, the most informative wavelengths of the 400–2500 nm region can be selected. Second, it allows the use of a narrow spectrum feature necessary for assessing vegetation biochemical properties (Broge & Mortensen, 2002). Many studies have shown that hyperspectral measurements can be used to quantify biophysical characteristics of the vegetation at leaf scale (Gitelson et al., 2003, le Maire et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2005) or at canopy scale using in situ data, airborne sensors like AVIRIS, CASI and HyMap, or spaceborne sensors like Hyperion and CHRIS.

Different methods exist to retrieve canopy characteristics from reflectance measurements (Blackburn, 2007, Kimes et al., 2000, Weiss and Baret, 1999):

- (i)
    
    _Indices and/or multiple regressions_: the principle is to combine several reflectances measured on narrow or large spectral bands into mathematical combinations and to correlate them to a particular characteristic of the observed surface. These relationships are calibrated based on an experimental or simulated reflectance database (built up on radiative transfer models). These methods are simple, but have some limits: when calibrated to an experimental database, the representativeness of the relationships is limited to the representativeness of the database. Moreover, indices and multiple regressions may be sensitive to more than one single characteristic. They are also sensitive to atmospheric conditions, view geometry, and spatial resolution, and therefore they must usually be calibrated for each image.
    
- (ii)
    
    _Model inversions_: this method uses models that simulate reflectance spectra from canopy and soil characteristics. As noted by Bacour et al. (2006), inversion techniques based on pre-computed reflectance database are often preferred to more computationally heavy iterative methods for operational applications. Among the computationally efficient methods often used are Look-Up Tables (e.g. Knyazikhin et al., 1998) and Neural Networks (e.g. Bacour et al., 2006, Baret et al., 2007). Both methods are dependent on the simulated training database. Inversion of such models often gives a large number of different possible solutions. Moreover, uncertainties in measurements and models may result in large variation in results (Combal et al., 2003).
    

The best way to find efficient indices would be to use a large measurement database, with many images and canopy conditions. Such a large database with hundreds of measurements is feasible at the leaf scale but is not conceivable at the forest scale. Moreover, indices calibrated on a particular forest canopy database could be unsuitable in other forests.

This issue leads us to create a large synthetic database containing reflectance spectra and their corresponding canopy characteristics. Such a database has many advantages: many canopy characteristics are represented (thousands of spectra); the influence of each characteristic can be totally decoupled from that of others; and the effect of a particular characteristic on the spectra is based on physical processes that are modeled at a small scale. Therefore, well established indices obtained on such a large simulated database may potentially be applied to a wide range of spectra. However, the use of a model relies on its capacity to correctly simulate the reflectance of a wide range of canopies. Thus, it is essential to test these indices on experimental measurements. The representativeness of the simulated database is therefore critical.

In this study, we generate two simulated databases, one at leaf scale with the PROSPECT model, and one at canopy scale coupling the PROSPECT leaf model with the SAIL canopy radiative transfer model (PROSAIL). At leaf scale, we continue the study done in le Maire et al. (2004) using an improved and newly calibrated version of the PROSPECT model (Feret et al., 2008), and a larger experimental database. The work at this scale is a first step to interpret the results at the canopy scale and explain possible discrepancies. At canopy scale, we use a multi-layer version of the SAIL model (Weiss et al., 2001), which is able to represent the vertical LMA profile. The study is restricted to canopies with LAI greater than 3 to correspond with the big-leaf representation of SAIL. These simulated databases are used to find best indices of CHL and LMA at leaf scale, and CHL, LMA, LAI and Bleaf at canopy scale.

Results are tested against measurements at both scales. At leaf scale we used a large database of 246 spectra and 49 species. At canopy scales, experimental measurements consist of ground measurements on small and mature canopies with a portable spectroradiometer, and hyperspectral images for two distinct forests measured with the Hyperion satellite.

We first describe the PROSPECT and SAIL models, simulated databases and the determination method of best spectral indices. Then, we present the experimental protocols for the measurements (leaf reflectance measurements, in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing data). The results are given at leaf and canopy scale for the determination of CHL, LMA, LAI and leaf biomass.

## The Leaf reflectance model PROSPECT

An improved (1-nm resolution) and recalibrated version of the leaf reflectance model PROSPECT has been used in this study (Feret et al., 2008). The PROSPECT model (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990, Jacquemoud et al., 1996) considers the leaf as a succession of absorbing layers. The new version calculates the leaf hemispherical reflectance and transmittance between 400 and 2500 nm with a 1-nm step as a function of leaf structure index (Nstruc), leaf chlorophyll content (CHL, µg/cm2), leaf water

## Reflectance measurements at leaf scale

Spectra were measured for _Acer pseudoplatanus_ (_n_ = 248) and other temperate species (_n_ = 48) that were cultivated in a large range of fertility, radiation and watering conditions to obtain a large range of leaf chlorophyll, leaf dry matter and leaf water content. Reflectance and transmittance were measured with the FieldSpec-FR spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, Colorado-USA) coupled with an integrative sphere (Li-Cor 1800, Li-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Measurements

## Leaf scale CHL indices

The ND type index, which is a normalized difference of two wavelengths, is calibrated on the PROSPECT simulated reflectance database. Fig. 2a shows the RMSE represented as contour plots. All local minima have RMSE values better than 10 µg cm− 2. The size of these areas gives visual information on the necessary spectral precision. The plot is shown between 400 and 1000 nm because no significant additional information is found after 1000 nm for CHL.

A contour plot is obtained in the same way for

## General discussion

Results at canopy scale varied from good (CHL and LMA) to fair (LAI and Bleaf) with the wavelengths determined on the synthetic database. However, the regression between indices and biophysical characteristics had to be calibrated to measurements. The error observed with simulation-based regressions may be due either to errors in the PROSAIL model, to a bias in the simulated database inputs, or both.

The PROSPECT sub-model of PROSAIL was shown to perform well at leaf scale, except for LMA

## Conclusion

To obtain generic and widely applicable canopy biophysical indices, the methodology chosen was to find the best possible indices without a priori knowledge of wavelengths, by testing every possible combination on a synthetic database. At the canopy level, results from very different experimental datasets were found to be consistent and well aligned for each retrieved quantity (CHL, LMA, LAI and Bleaf). The results are strengthened by the experimental aspect of this work based on two different

## Abstract

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 μm and a near-IR channel around 0.86 μm. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as , where ϱ represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-μm and the 1.24-μm channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 μm is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 μm is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86–1.24 μm region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-μm channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 μm, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.

## Abstract

A set of Landsat Thematic Mapper images representing a wide range of vegetation conditions from the NASA Landsat Pathfinder, global land cover test site (GLCTS) initiative were processed to simulate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), global vegetation index imagery at 250 m pixel size resolution. The sites included boreal forest, temperate coniferous forest, temperate deciduous forest, tropical rainforest, grassland, savanna, and desert biomes. Differences and similarities in sensitivity to vegetation conditions were compared among various spectral vegetation indices (VIs). All VIs showed a qualitative relationship to variations in vegetation. However, there were significant differences among the VIs over desert, grassland, and forested biomes. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was sensitive to and responded primarily to the highly absorbing red reflectance band, while other indices such (is the soil and atmosphere resistant vegetation index (SARVI) were more responsive to variations in the near-infrared (NIR) band. As a result, we found the NDVI to mimic red reflectances and saturate over the forested sites while the SARVI, by contrast, did not saturate and followed variations in NIR refleetances. In the arid and semiarid biomes, the NDVI was much more sensitive to canopy background variations than the SARVI. Maximum differences among vegetation index behavior occurred over the evergreen needleleaf forest sites relative to the deciduous broadleaf forests and drier, grassland, and shrub sites. These differences appear to be useful in complementing the NDVI for improved monitoring of vegetation, with the NDVI sensitive to fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation and the SARVI more sensitive to structural canopy parameters such as leaf area index and leaf morphology.

## Abstract

Farmers must balance the competing goals of supplying adequate N for their crops while minimizing N losses to the environment. To characterize the spatial variability of N over large fields, traditional methods (soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and chlorophyll meters) require many point samples. Because of the close link between leaf chlorophyll and leaf N concentration, [remote sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/remote-sensing "Learn more about remote sensing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") techniques have the potential to evaluate the N variability over large fields quickly. Our objectives were to (1) select wavelengths sensitive to leaf chlorophyll concentration, (2) simulate [canopy reflectance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/canopy-reflectance "Learn more about canopy reflectance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") using a [radiative transfer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiative-transfer "Learn more about radiative transfer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") model, and (3) propose a strategy for detecting leaf chlorophyll status of plants using remotely sensed data. A wide range of leaf chlorophyll levels was established in field-grown [corn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/maize "Learn more about corn from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (_Zea mays_ L.) with the application of 8 N levels: 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150% of the recommended rate. Reflectance and [transmittance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/transmittance "Learn more about transmittance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") spectra of fully expanded upper leaves were acquired over the 400-nm to 1,000-nm wavelength range shortly after [anthesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/anthesis "Learn more about anthesis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with a [spectroradiometer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/spectroradiometers "Learn more about spectroradiometer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and integrating sphere. Broad-band differences in leaf spectra were observed near 550 nm, 715 nm, and >750 nm. Crop canopy reflectance was simulated using the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) canopy reflectance model for a wide range of background reflectances, leaf area indices (LAI), and leaf chlorophyll concentrations. Variations in background reflectance and LAI confounded the detection of the relatively subtle differences in canopy reflectance due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. Spectral [vegetation indices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/vegetation-index "Learn more about vegetation indices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that combined near-infrared reflectance and red reflectance (e.g., OSAVI and NIR/Red) minimized contributions of background reflectance, while spectral [vegetation indices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/vegetation-index "Learn more about vegetation indices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that combined reflectances of near-infrared and other visible bands (MCARI and NIR/Green) were responsive to both leaf chlorophyll concentrations and background reflectance. Pairs of these spectral vegetation indices plotted together produced isolines of leaf chlorophyll concentrations. The slopes of these isolines were linearly related to leaf chlorophyll concentration. A limited test with measured canopy reflectance and leaf chlorophyll data confirmed these results. The characterization of leaf chlorophyll concentrations at the field scale without the confounding problem of background reflectance and LAI variability holds promise as a valuable aid for [decision making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/decision-making "Learn more about decision making from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in managing N applications.

## Introduction

Nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth and is frequently the major limiting nutrient in most agricultural soils. Profitable corn (_Zea mays_ L.) production systems require inputs of large quantities of N. Nitrogen fertilizer in excess of a crop's nutritional needs may move into surface water and groundwater and contribute to eutrophication of lakes and streams (Wood et al., 1993). Farmers must balance the competing goals of supplying enough N to their crops while minimizing the loss of N to the environment, which represents both a threat to water quality and an economic loss. The economic penalties of reduced yields from supplying inadequate N are substantial.

Traditionally, soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and long-term field trials have been used for assessing N availability for crops. More recently, chlorophyll meters (e.g., SPAD-502,1 Minolta Osaka Co., Ltd., Japan) have been used to monitor plant N status by measuring transmittance of radiation through a leaf in two wavelength bands centered near 650 nm and 940 nm (e.g., Peterson et al. 1993, Blackmer et al. 1994, Wood et al. 1993). Leaf chlorophyll meter readings, which are essentially a measure of leaf greenness, are generally linear with extractable chlorophyll concentrations for a wide variety of crops. However, plant species and/or environmental conditions may affect the relationship (Wood et al., 1993). Markwell et al. (1995) theoretically justified the use of an exponential equation that forces a more appropriate fit to limited data sets than polynomial equations.

Because the majority of leaf N is contained in chlorophyll molecules, there is a close link between leaf chlorophyll content and leaf N content (Yoder and Pettigrew-Crosby, 1995). However, at high N levels, the relationship between leaf chlorophyll and leaf N concentration may be nonlinear, indicating the presence of nonchlorophyll N, probably NO3-N (Wood et al., 1993).

Although the chlorophyll meter allows a relative N assessment without time-consuming laboratory analysis, it required taking 30 or more readings from representative plants in each area of interest (Peterson et al., 1993), which can be time-consuming for large fields that have spatial variations in N. Blackmer and Schepers (1995) recommended interpreting the variability in chlorophyll meter readings relative to reference areas in each field, where N is not limiting. These in-field reference areas helped to normalize differences among cultivars, growth stages, and environmental conditions.

Remote sensing techniques, based on measuring the reflected radiation from plant canopies, have the potential of evaluating the N status of many plants within the field of view of the sensor. Spectral reflectance measurements of corn and wheat (_Triticum aestivium_ L.) canopies have been used to detect differences in N treatments Blackmer et al. 1996, Walburg et al. 1982, Hinzman et al. 1986. Differences in leaf area index, biomass, foliage cover, and leaf chlorophyll content resulted from the N treatments and contributed to the differences in canopy spectral reflectance observed. The relatively subtle differences in canopy reflectance associated with changes in leaf chlorophyll are often confounded with major changes in plant growth and development due to N treatments.

Blackmer et al. (1996) calculated the reflectance of corn canopies relative to reference canopies supplied with nonlimiting available N. They found that the ratio of reflected radiation in a visible band (550–600 nm) and a near-infrared band (800–900 nm) could be used to detect N stress in corn. The use of relative reflectance helped reduce variability in the measurements. They speculated that the characterization of the spatial patterns in canopy reflectance can be the basis for developing technologies for the application of N at variable rates to agricultural fields.

Our objectives were (1) to select wavelengths sensitive to leaf chlorophyll concentration; (2) to simulate canopy reflectance, using a radiative transfer model, for a range of leaf optical properties, leaf area indices, and soil backgrounds; and (3) to propose a strategy for detecting N status of crops using remotely sensed data.

## Materials and methods

Corn (_Zea mays_ L.) was grown on a Woodstown sandy loam soil devoted to long-term N application rate studies at Beltsville, Maryland. The field was maintained at high soil test levels of P and K. Ammonium nitrate was applied after planting to supply 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150% of the recommended rate of 180 kg N/ha and to establish a range of leaf chlorophyll levels. Plot size was 6 m×15 m and each N treatment was replicated twice. Grain from each plot was hand-harvested at

## Leaf Reflectance and Transmittance

Mean leaf chlorophyll concentrations are presented in Table 2. Total chlorophyll concentrations more than doubled as N fertilizer application rates increased. Chlorophyll concentrations were not significantly different at N rates above 135 kg/ha or 75% of the recommended management practice. Grain yields increased rapidly as more N fertilizer was applied but plateaued at 180 kg N/ha. Water was also limited during late grain filling and probably contributed to the lack of differences in grain

## Summary

Leaf chlorophyll concentration is an indicator of plant N status. Changes in leaf chlorophyll concentrations produce rather broad-band differences in leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra. However, the transition from leaf spectra to canopy reflectance spectra is complicated. Variations in background reflectance and LAI confounded detection of relatively subtle differences in canopy reflectance due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. Some spectral vegetation indices (e.g., OSAVI

## Abstract

Algorithms based on reflectance band ratios have been developed for the remote estimation of chlorophyll _a_, chlorophyll _b_, chlorophyll _a+b_, and total [carotenoid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/carotenoid "Learn more about carotenoid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") content of [Eucalyptus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/eucalypt "Learn more about Eucalyptus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") leaves. Reflectance spectra over the 400–2500 nm range with a [spectral resolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/spectral-resolution "Learn more about spectral resolution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of 2 nm and the content of chlorophylls _a_, _b_, _a+b_, and total carotenoids were determined for leaves from several Eucalyptus species covering a wide range of chlorophyll _a_ content (0.0121–0.0435 mg/cm2). Maximum sensitivity of reflectance to variation in pigment content was found in the green wavelength region at 550 nm and at 708 nm in the far-red wavelengths. The reflectance in the main pigment absorption regions in the blue (400–500 nm) and red (660–690 nm) wavelengths proved to be insensitive to variation in pigment content. The ratio _R_672/(_R_550× _R_708) correlated best with chlorophyll _a_, chlorophyll _a+b_, and total [carotenoid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/carotenoid "Learn more about carotenoid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") contents. The ratio _R_672/_R_550 correlated best with chlorophyll _b_ content. Reflectance ratios involving near infrared bands such as _R_750/_R_550 and _R_750/_R_700 did not correlate well with pigment content. This was due to the differential scattering effects of the wide range of young and mature leaf samples. A method was developed for adjusting all spectra to the same level of scatter. The near-infrared-based reflectance ratios from the scatter adjusted spectra showed high sensitivity to pigment content. The ratio _R_860/(_R_550_×R_708) from the scatter adjusted spectra correlated best with chlorophyll _a_, chlorophyll _a+b_, and total carotenoid contents, while _R_860/_R_550 correlated best with chlorophyll _b_ content. The newly developed algorithms were tested on a validation data set and allowed accurate estimates of leaf pigment content. The pigment contents estimated by the ratios from untransformed spectra, _R_672/(_R_550_×R_708) and _R_672/_R_550, were found to be not significantly different from the estimates obtained using the scatter-adjusted reflectance ratios, _R_860/(_R_550_×R_708) and _R_860/_R_550.

## Introduction

Spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared regions of the spectrum have been used to develop a number of indices for estimating chlorophyll content. Reflectance in the main chlorophyll absorption region near 675 nm has been used for a long time as an indicator of chlorophyll content of leaves Benedict and Swidler 1961, Wallihan 1973. However, the relationship between reflectance near 675 nm and chlorophyll content has been shown to become saturated at medium to high chlorophyll contents, and consequently this index is only suitable for estimation of very low levels of leaf chlorophyll content (Thomas and Gausman, 1977). The commonly used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), defined as (_R_NIR−_R_RED)/(_R_NIR+_R_RED), was developed by contrasting the strong chlorophyll absorption in the red wavelengths with the high reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths (Rouse et al., 1973). The NDVI has also been found to be insensitive to medium and high chlorophyll concentrations Buschman and Nagel 1993, Vogelman et al. 1993, Gitelson and Merzlyak 1994, Gitelson and Merzlyak 1996, Lichtenthaler et al. 1996. Recent studies have developed several new vegetation indices based on other visible wavelength bands instead of the red wavelengths near 670–680 nm.

Chappelle et al. (1992) found good correlations between _R_675/_R_700 and chlorophyll _a_ concentration, _R_675/(_R_650×_R_700) and chlorophyll _b_ concentration, and _R_760/_R_500 and total carotenoid concentration in soybean leaves. A number of other studies have found strong correlations between the reflectance around the green peak near 550 nm and chlorophyll _a_ concentration Thomas and Gausman 1977, Buschman and Nagel 1993, Yoder and Waring 1994, Gitelson and Merzlyak 1994, Gitelson and Merzlyak 1996, Gitelson et al. 1996a, Gitelson et al. 1996b, Lichtenthaler et al. 1996, Schepers et al. 1996. The region near 700 nm has also been found to be highly sensitive to chlorophyll _a_ concentration Gitelson and Merzlyak 1994, Gitelson and Merzlyak 1996, Gitelson et al. 1996a, Gitelson et al. 1996b, Gitelson et al. 1996c, Lichtenthaler et al. 1996, Schepers et al. 1996. Gitelson et al. (1996b) found that ratios of reflectances in the near-infrared range of the spectrum (above 750 nm) to that at 700 nm and 550 nm, _R_750/_R_700 and _R_750/_R_550 were well correlated with the total chlorophyll content of maple, chestnut, and cotoneatser leaves. Similarly, Gitelson and Merzlyak 1994, Gitelson and Merzlyak 1996, Gitelson et al. (1996c), and Lichtenthaler et al. (1996) have all found good correlations between _R_750/_R_700, _R_750/_R_550, and chlorophyll _a_ and total chlorophyll content of several types of leaves. Gitelson et al. (1996a) developed a “green” NDVI, defined as NDVI=(_R_NIR−_R_GREEN)/(_R_NIR+_R_GREEN), by using the green wave- length channel near 550 nm. They found the green NDVI to be sensitive to a much wider range of chlorophyll concentration than the original NDVI.

Most of the algorithms reported in the literature have been developed using leaf reflectance measurements carried out on a few deciduous and coniferous species from the northern hemisphere. Such algorithms need to be applied to other species from different geographical and climatic regions of the world to see if they are indeed general. The evergreen Eucalyptus forests of Australia are very different from the vegetation types usually described in remote sensing literature. The leaves of Eucalyptus species are generally pendulous, their canopies are semitransparent and yield an open forest of uniform structure (Greaves and Spencer, 1993). Eucalyptus is by far the most important genus of Australian forest trees. There are over 500 species of Eucalyptus which dominate 95% of the forests and woodlands of Australia Australian Forestry and Timber Bureau 1957, Boland et al. 1984. Very few high spectral resolution reflectance studies have been carried out on Eucalyptus species in Australia Howard 1966, Pearman 1966, Cameron 1970, Sinclair and Thomas 1970, Thomas and Barber 1974, O’Neill et al. 1990, and none of these have investigated the relationships between reflectance and leaf biochemistry. This study is the first to investigate, in detail, the relationship between leaf pigment content and reflectance for Eucalyptus species.

The main aims of this study were to analyze the relationship between spectral reflectance features and pigment content of leaves from selected Eucalyptus species, and to develop algorithms for predicting pigment content of Eucalyptus species.

## Study Sites, Species, and Sample Collection

A total of 21 species were selected for this study from two sites within New South Wales. The sites were located at Lane Cove National Park (33°48′S/151°10′E, 11 km northwest of Sydney) and Nullica State Forest (37°S/149°45′E, 20 km northwest of Eden township). Twenty of the species represented some of the most common Eucalyptus species found in New South Wales, while one non-Eucalyptus species (_Angophora costata_) was selected because of its common occurrence in the Eucalyptus forests at the

## Leaf Pigment Content and Concentrations

The pigment concentration and content data are summarized in Table 1. The data set shows a large range of pigment concentrations and contents.

In laboratory NIRS studies involving dried ground samples, the leaf biochemistry has usually been expressed as concentration (mass per unit dry weight). However, in reflectance studies of intact fresh or dry leaves, the biochemistry has often been expressed as content (mass per unit leaf area). The use of content rather than concentration has been found

## Conclusions

Analysis of visible/near-infrared reflectance and pigment data for a wide range of Eucalyptus leaves has revealed some new information on the quantification of pigment content by remote sensing. It was found that the NIR reflectance did not remain invariant with pigment content due to differences in the scattering properties of new and older leaves. As such the existing pigment indices such as _R_750/_R_550 and _R_750/_R_700 did not correlate well with pigment content. The reflectance at 672 nm showed
